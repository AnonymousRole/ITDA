# Authorship Style Transfer with Inverse Transfer Data Augmentation
This is the offficial implementation of the paper [Authorship Style Transfer with Inverse Transfer Data Augmentation].
## Overview
Authorship style transfer aims to modify the style of neutral text to match the unique speaking or writing style of a particular individual. We propose an inverse transfer data augmentation ITDA method, leveraging GPT-3.5 to create (neutral text, stylized text) pairs. We use this augmented dataset to train a BART-base model adept at style transfer. Our experimental results, conducted across four datasets with distinct authorship styles, establish the effectiveness of ITDA over style transfer using GPT-3.5.
## Evaluation Results
We evaluate ITDA on four benchmarks: Lin Daiyu, Shakespeare, Trump, Lyrics. We adopt four metrics: BLEU and BS (BERTScore) measure content preservation, SC measures style transfer
strength, and GPT-4 measures overall performance.

Since user-provided text often spans a range of topics, we also collect a new test set comprising neutral texts spanning diverse topics to do out-of-distribution evaluation.
