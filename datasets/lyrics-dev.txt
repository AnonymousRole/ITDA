Is this the life that you've wieved?
Why wont you fall in love with me?(x2)
Keeping me at the back of the queue
no one knows what's going through her mind
While he's out dining A La Carte
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
THIS HOUSE IS A TRAP
You used to let us ride off
This shit too light man
Dans tous les Hilton de la terre
Calling calling all the world
You're the one I need
If you didn't know me then, Guaranteed you know me now...
Make ya bald head like a bowling ball
Boy, you know just how to satisfy me
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
The tides are turning now
Can't get enough of this,
You can't judge her for that.
Do your best just keep on laughing
And brought by there right to your door
That we won't be wastin' time tonight
I knew you were the only frog for me
Where people stay and pray everyday
So hold on for your life
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here!
But all in love is fair
No me pidas nunca que vuelva jamÃ¡s
'Cause you know that we could read each others minds
Be Frank and say "I Did It My Way"
What are we without the air we breath?
We must endure and keep strong
Well I'm offering you this heart of mine
You wallow in the guilt; you wallow in the pain
Yeah, I get world sick, my love is for my man
I suppose, can you bring him back?
wagamama mo ima wa itoshikute
It was just my imagination x3
Hit me with your best (shot)
You must know what I mean
Got to keep on plodding onward with your precious load
New new shit so sick, chicken pox
When nothing you do can change my mind
All the girls in the world beware
I hear your name in the papers
At least I thought I knew you then
Sail away with me honey
and Im just not ready to let u go yet
All gas, no brakes, might break your face
Catch a fire so you can get burned
Living life and going nowhere
A beggar at a feast
I didn't know what life was all about
I have never been the one
You better watch, you better watch your back
Naw nigga I'm just lying my nigga I be fronting
I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me, yeah
Saying all the things you do
I got those good times
No-one beside me on train rides
Want m'n haute couture is o zo duur
A nigga spent his last quadruple of cash
Come on give it to me
Afraid I realize the train won't stop
There goes Billy and Susie walkin' hand in hand
You can listen to the engine
Children sing their songs and skin their knees
So he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone
Lotta stick ups in town, Freddie Foxxx is back
Lift them pull them from the gardens
This thing will strike you dumb
theres one one wrong desire
I have to ride a blind
Let your heart run free,
you will never mind what i ever said before,
Have y'all niggas ever thought about
I got a "S" on my chest
In an abandoned warehouse in Miami
One that don't give a fuck
And it's just my luck. I like you but I
If only you'd come back around
How do I work this?
And tell me you think I'm a fool
Hold on and on and on won't you hold on
Aim for my aim for my veins
Lordy, it was love at first bite
A fool pretendin' that love's never ending
I'll give you all that I got
It takes a little time sometimes
West side Piru, I love this shit Blood
Don't you think that I want to see him in a different way
It was just the kind of thing,
Take a walk on the wild side of life, of life
I'll soothe your troubled mind
I know we're gonna triumph
We are the ones who wanna change the world (We'll all change the world)
I tie up your boy and rape your girlfriend
Will ever take its place
(Make me get the strap) And then do something else
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
Oh if heaven wouldn't see
Komm zu uns und schrei mit Wut
You've got somebody who will spend some time with you baby
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
And I think I am too weak to hold on,
Firefly, could you shine your light
que aqui me tienes tambien
Your style stinks kid, ya garbage
Everything a man could want, but she's not you
Cock a rock hammer, niggas gang bang, pull out and bang bang
How could you take me another way
Deine Mutter hat gesagt: "Tragt nicht soviel Dreck rein!".
Girl watch how its gon' drive you crazy
Gonna dance like nobody's watching
All I want in this life of mine
sand in my hand (ooh)
Fure au ai wa muteki saka sou futari wa shuyaku
Lookin' back on what I've done
If living without a feeling is really living
You know that you want me, but I want you closer than close.
You got it all, no one could ask for more
cowards whine beyond the olden gate
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Are my tears entrancing you well I don't remember inviting you
I hope your world stays rosy red the sky is blue above your head
'Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
Three little kids for the flavor, stir carefully through the days
I don't think you know me much at all
As a matter of fact?
Like a motherfucking tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around
takes me back to the start
(I'm not too sure but you know I want you, I know)
Love is everything, hate is smaller
Que nos parte en dos
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love
If you let him take me from you
All your life you'll never be
Thank God that yesterday's gone
I hear when you're drinking and cheating on your lonely wife
Will you ever let me find the place
I was a giant in the hood passin rocks to LT
And after all this time, to find we're just like all the rest
I feel like the feats gonna happen
Am the only whoah oh oh yeah yeah yeah
Her clothes I did shuck, just like Dan I strictly stuck
From the pump and dump to the bait and switch,
With a team of freelance mercenaries we standing
Won't break your heart and tell you lies
That you climbed over on your way down
So give in to the heat of the moment
now a christmas time everybody fi' sing
'Cause there's no room for me in a room full of you
Hop in the truck(framed out)
Your crew fell, you jail 'cause mine doin it
Komm drÃ¼ck auf like sie gefÃ¤llt dir doch auch
From the bottom of the well
Carranza, da vueltas la cuadra,
'Cause a big bit of nothing don't take blues away
But if Souter and Thomas have their way
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
putevima bluda, da, pros'o sam i tuda.
let's steal from the lost and found
You were my comfort zone
Laying on the bed, both of us half naked
But it ain't no way to live
they tell you who you are
I'm so elegant, scientifically intelligent
It keeps me up, it keeps me tight
Turn it up baby make your move
That's the way you made us
I can't remember if I cried
You know I'd do anything for ya
If this comes your way, baby, prepare to spray, let 'em lay
Dividing presence from our history
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Yeah, just another song on that old guitar
There's nothing I can do
Ya hips ya thigh ya whole demeanor
whatever WILL BE, WILL BE
With people like you humanity's damned
No one you can trust
Pick the blame and ...
[Minzy] Wae ireon nae mameul ajik molla
Now we can do whatever we wanna do
So lets get doe together
Convincively I can advance Dee, it's a prophecy
Cause it will strangle yeah
si al final todo el amor
Or if you just want some company
Shake it baby, get on it (x6)
It comes right back to you
Even though we go through these changes
But you know, but you know...
But there's still some things that I don't want to hear.
We're pullin strings, killin kings
Oh, as soon as you're used to one season it moves,
Im a freak freak freak
How you scream my name the only time you use in vain
As you lie naked in the dark sunshine
Rings fly, you my wife
Sweet and somber pigeon wings
Have a good time when you fall
Turn her on, lift her arm, notice that her wrists is wrong
Maybe they got day jobs
Oh my love, You bring me clarity amidst the chaos
Who am I e.d. the green eyed bandit
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
Oh baby you, let me down easy
I see a new day dawning
All in ya honey, walkin 'round countin ya money
rido come voi, lo prendo in culo come voi. Ma amo piu' di voi.
Can't you see what I need?
Temperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level
Through the hues we?ll find a way to follow
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
Winters come, and winters go
What I'm gone do when I see that boy, grab a bottle and BUST EM'
Where I am now, where I am now, And I belong
Where they don't speak Englas or Espaniol, no
(I've got them candy kisses on my mind)
Thirtys in the city movin' slow
Tall as a fucking rail.
It's not too off to be what we are
He stayed right to the end and he
I can't let you get away from me
Give it up give it up, oh
Und mich lieb' ich noch dazu, also mir ist es genug
Better find, better find out
Who do boys like they're girls
cause we can't be beat!
It always seems no matter what I do
More Free Beer for the Skins - More Free Beer
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
'Cause lipstick on you collar told a tale on you, yeah
Only to be stolen by a Thief, the Judas Preist
Yeah, she got it written on her
I don't know how to say goodbye
You gotta save me then save the world
And the hand that I can hold
Taxi! might even git in a fight.
Standing on your shoulders I can touch the sky
On this one right here, ya heard me?
And I found this reason to decide
Where I must fairly go(?)
You stole my heart with just one look
como es posible que alguien
But don't you dare ride through the SWATS without, at least 30 shots
I will lay me down
They'll hurt you, and desert you
Ima call you out, Ima call you out
Or is it true that you did surrender
J'me disais, si je chante l'espoir
Can I find, can I find, can I find You,
How can they be tired of London
Insane but at the same time so revealing to give you all the feeling
So set 'em straight and finally say
"Equality," I spoke the word as if a wedding vow
A flip of a switch,
In your fear where you lay
Fuck you and fuck a lie to you open your brew on
With every breath every step I take
The world is at your feet
A parent who sows a seed
We are the black light
Then you'll see that we got a raw deal
In my city getting paper
Only the devil is stoppin me from eatin swine
Run game and probably leave the party with somebody
Thought I'd know just what to do
Let me sew your panic button, let me in to that
Were the folks that you met there
Yeah, THAT was the track, now...
If I live - I live - I live for you
And I see your face and everything's ok
Watched my cat die for a month now I have seen a sheepish wonder
Female I like, what I want to give all night
You don't really wanna see me cross dat line
And the flames keep getting higher
So save your scissors someone else's skin
I guess that I need time
Just avoid the clip with the gauge
It seems to me I'm not doing anything new
cuando estas junto a mi
Living it up, I wanna clean it all out now
I dont owe you no nothin like I said once befoe and
Show you I will...give everything I am
Whatever is gonna make you want me
You got to rewind every one of my lines,
Diction very bad, friction double rich
Do what you should honey
That we knew ourselves in silence
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
You take a piece of me with you
To the love that won't give up with you
And see our shadows on the ground
What you mean you ain't nasty
You laugh your laugh and hold my body fast
By young men who try to reduce her down
You looked around and it wasn't there
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
Where you don't need no dough
My legato is staccato but what I don't fret
There's something like a void I feel
Dreaming of a blue horizon
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
Like you said, it's so-o hard
Well death is where I could of gone
But still we keep pretending
That means I must be livin it livin it livin it
There ain't another on the whole reservation
I think about my happiest times
A toothless bitch to blow him for a vile of crack
Everybody's grooving, everything's just fine
Do you think this is a game that anyone can play
Making sure that everything is stylistically right.
Get it how you live, I'm a known survivor
Cause when the walls come crashing in
From the words that you need to say
cresciuto su ad acqua e pane
And the moon is the only, only light we see
And I'll never let you go
And how you always undo what you told
have the right to stay
Got me looking so crazy right now
Si nous dposions les armes
It's time to be a man now
He went on down the road
Gibraltar Rock and now the Emerald Isle
'Cause I hate you and baby you hate me
Safe, safe in a dream we will be safe
I was making that tool work
Gimme a massage den show me how dem lips feel
Would love to love you
until I finally find you on the planet of love
Anything but silence or the truth
Son las cosas tontas que me hace decir el alcohol
It was '89 and yo, I'm stayin' out of fights
Six out of seven still leaves you one shy
Ya know what I' saying
It's a dirty job but someones gotta do it
I knew you were different from the way I caved;
Some way to get through to you
There a pump organ that lives on air
I don't need your credit, and you ain't got it to give it
never going to let go...
In one year mang, a nigga's so paid
One love, one love, one love, one love
It's got to get better
I had enough of the blues,
There was nothing I could say
That every day i see you closer.
When on every single impulse, on every other move I react.
No sÃ© por quÃ© tÃº me niegas
And now I'm touching myself
Hum a sad, sad tune,
doch hÃ¼ck Naach weiÃ ich nit wo dat enden soll.
You made me want you
I can feel it in my head, another lie,
Where there's a music should be comin' out of every car
(Aides:) But the answer is ...
But I can't tell the difference
I'm still Mr. Money ain't thing
I said I touch the world and the world said
It's good to be king
Peace to the seeds, peace to the birth
put it over so politly, you tried to flip the scripts
Excuse me motherfuckers, can I beg your pardon
Until I hear sirens, I'm gone with the wind
I don't know who I am
Do not sing this song
Nosotros somos los de me quedo, si te quedas
There were girls with eyes so blue
Fate fell short this time
If you ain't runnin' game
When I need someone to love
Am I alive or dead?
,La, la, la, la whoa.
Then run home to recover
You are the only God
I don't understand (understand) why I'm crazy over you (crazy)
Que esta pasando? algo esta cambiando
And you can have your Trix
I mean, I'm take off... 1, 2, 3...
Just in case you didn't know
And a Tony Montana cigar
My niggaz run this bitch! Nah hoe!
Stand or fall I know there
And lift our voices higher
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
If you think I'm believing that one, you're obviously dumb)
Kein Ahnung, wo es hingeht,
I'm still waiting, waiting (Ah, ha), waiting
Howling like a mongel praying for a friend
Should I paint the Grey sky blue, the Grey sky blue?
Why spend our lives on bended knee
M.r., my number one fan (what?!)
This will be the last time, This will be the last time
And even though we seperated, you said that you'd wait
You are always on my mind
You can rise above the world below
Just tell me the truth, it makes me feel better
We are the feeling you get in the golden state
He said "If these were my last words,
And I will love thee still, my dear,
took me where heaven is
So many days gone by
And I'll try hard to be more understanding
Same old thing happen every day
Y que no olvides que al volver
My chain in the ocean
I wanna rock, I wanna rock yo body
Lift up your eyes and see
(You're gonna be just fine)
There ain't no sunshine when it's on
I could dance all night, I could shake with delight,
Why you gotta make it so ha-hard on me?
Won't you call me if you need me
your made 4 me no doubt about that [x3]
And I believe in, I believe in
I don't want to wait for your love
Slip it like a glove around you
We take a little walk
From obstructing my discussion 'cause I rhyme too hard
You'll spend your last heartbeat chasing after rainbows
where the moon shines directly on your bed
If you ain't a thug nigga, you ain't really doin' nothin'
Don't you mourn for me when my soul is free
We got that fie fie, we got that fie fie
And no one is to blame
Where I need find a reason to be strong
We're like Heckle and Jeckle, Jeckle and Hyde
You and me, you and me, you and me
Y se acerca la linea policÃ­aca
High powered on my way to the west side
Descubriendo la dulzura tÃº habitabas en mi
[All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way
Hes got one more mile to remember
You were another girl's boyfriend
Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth
And cross your heart and hope to die (May Queen)
Shake and tumble down with me baby
Dream begins it's becoming clearer
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
What a man, what a man, what a man,
Where my dogs at, hold it down
Go find a man that will obey
And go and cop an island
Speaking my name to try to confuse me
I shape the wig like a woodblock
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
Knew I had to let it be
I live the way I choose
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
So at the age of 15, I entered the dope game
But she's a black magic woman
Wont stop now and still I try
Serpiente que el pellejo se le enmuda
I made it Ma roman numeral I
I'm somethin' like sippin' on Dom Perignon
I feel your heart is turned to stone
To wake, wake me up, up, up in time
'Cause they looked much better on you
We are civilized and free from all confusion
It's getting better, nothing like two girls sticking together
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
And since, life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
That's called my bullets and lugers, I put 'em deep in your neck.
Et je me donne de toutes mes forces
get out of hand I ask you,
Anyone who had a heart
A big black wide gorilla
You might have to go and find a party
The needle won't skip and shit
Hasn't there been enough cryin'
Sittin' on the floor on my bedroom cryin'
Asleep when the alarms went off
I put thirty in your head, all in the same hole
And you´re working for your days
She's got me pinned, my back to the wall I'm thinking this is it
I couldn't take much more of you
Don't want to take a nap, I want a TV tat
And, oh, when I'm in your warm embrace
I thought it would be easy
In a crowd, you're all alone
More of us than you
The preacher shuts his eyes
I spent too much time for one night
And I don't care what they say, baby, I love your way with me
An itch too sensitive to scratch
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
Watch them rape the land
Just painting a picture for me
Because we rising up despite of the economy
A radio plays `White Christmas'
I love the way you make me lose my mind
So glamorous in the '70s
These rocks don't lose their shape
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
Dont know if its wrong, dont know if it right, everytime I'm with you I feel brand new
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
But your heroes arent what they seem
But it has to end
You'll do nothing but get married and make noise in bed.
One who gave you to me
And we should be apart, now it's over like a holiday
shorty tryina take control of me got me sayin damn
Everyone Has Been Shot, Everyone Has Been Shot
I will lash out and make you see
So beautiful and drop dead hot
Living on let it go, open eyes surprise yo let's role
If I should bend I'll bend too
Plus playin for keeps in these New York streets
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby
Within yourself and within your mind
To do it by yourself
Cuando no sabÃ­a de nada
And I hold it down
Then it felt like going through the motions
But you better give it to her
He gon give it to ya
We gotta suck it in
You came and you changed my life
Scream and shout 'till we work it out?
N im makin sure im all good,
I remember all the heavy touch with you
Without notes in tune with the time that surrounds.
We live in the same building, but we got different views
Onde as horas nunca vo passar
Well, run round di corner
With the gun up on my waist, I'm losing patience
But you're one of them
Grinning with a lost stare
The state of our condition.
When I see a man, I see a lion
And hope for better days
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all
We drop it on a
I see your little insomnia
Third shot slapped in the head with a juice box
And turned it back into gold
Before I need her tenderness
Well I think you know what I'm trying to say
And come through my window and don't be shy
I know the king will come again
Well tonight, I'll give you every bit of my heart,
I told him I didn't think I had
It makes you feel the pain even when you're not ill
I want to leave this town
there's no point coming here no more
Sour smoke out the nasal
Boy I'm drinking park it in my lot 711. I'm rubbing.
He used to tell me all the time, "yo your lyrics is hype
Now I'll drink myself slowly to sleep
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleeding
Work (Put it in work)
even though i've tried so hard i do
Take my hand and I will never give up hope
I'm not yr footnote, freakshow
I wonder who's stepping into my shoes
I'd still miss you babe and I don't wanna miss a thing
That broken heart will be forever and a lifetime
Arms both scarred so deeply
Got your head between your legs hoping it returns
Like a plane that's coming down
Are fed in the flames
Of everything you wanted to say
I put my trust into my faith everyday
Pushed too hard at Beeches Brook
Cause youre gonna keep it hid
Just take a look at your body now,
Sag nichts und vergiss mich!
I'm in the top five no you can't creep wit me
I'm wanderin' I am wanderin'
smokin weed listenin to run DMC?
Or am I all alone
Well I'mma open up that map and see the nation
But you said goodbye to me
I feel you on my fingertips
Die Zeit hier war so schÃ¶n
Take two of this tit, d-do-do-dit dit
'Cause I can't picture me being without you
The Lord, strong and mighty
A lime to a lemon remind you of the sky when I'm fuckin' and we on cloud nine for that minute
Running caddywampus but extremely focused
Mujhko toh tere chehre pe yeh ghum nahin janchta
These nigga's they really do hate me (Fuck Sosa, I wish he die)
Fears has created many hostile years
Well I guess I don't mind
Remember boys, always open her beer first
But I just can't 'cause the drama just grows greater
Folks know if they're falling on hard times
Your dog or your brother,
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin
Names that you thought had heart, but seen fleeing
But don't let go, this is paradise
When you've forgotten me I'll remember you
Now I've gotta move on and survive
But You Know I Love You
But it's the same ol' Joe so don't get K.O.D.
But you can't take my P.O with the metal flake
Run up with some work, and get your head CRACKED for that
You'll be commissioning a symphony in C
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
When I do, I'm caught on
A presence full of love
You are the love of my life
The plane is on fire, the fucking ship is sinking.
Could be today or tonight
Isle of freedom, isle of fears
lost like a voiceless troubadour
Suspicion that things here are not as they seem
Now I'm losing who I am
There's bones in the sink
Feel it, Taste the victory
When the ice hit the light, it twinkle and glisten
Love is such a wonderful thing
The time is now a'come
We watch the white horse run
ElderlyÂ¹s memories that never grow old
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
never showed concern, when the tables were turned.
Dem a rubbish so we gather dem push dem up inna heat
Once around the stump, then twice across the ceiling,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
(Uh -1st time come on - 2nd)
And in your troubled mind
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck
Go, greased lightnin', you're coastin' through the heat lap trial
I wish that I could love you
Only if you like rocking jazz
Hoping that this is all just a dream
And the day I came to
I can tell that you're watching me
magla c"es"lja pramen na ulici
It's after hours, you've got the power
And the night goes by so very slow
Need to know if you were really gone
How you gon' win if you never wanna risk nothin'
Schau mich nicht so an
Put a little love in your heart
Where the big deal this cowboy gear sewn in Japan?
My confidant but now you wanna be the one
Como duele ver caer el cielo
It's just dry lightning and you on my mind
would you be wise enough 2 let me go
Well there's nothing I wouldn't give
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven
But you're the only sure thing that I've found
I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm fantasy man
She gave everything, gave everything to me
Tho' he tried his best to settle down
Into the blackness. Into the night.
And you laugh and you cry
Building a house of fire, baby
And who lags get body bagged in Mazarati bags zipped with toe tags
Just look in my eyes
But I don't even know her name
So say what you want me to say
I might straight panic, pull the gat, and blow your pussy out your pants
Hustling them E's and that C's and that H
Your hands on the wheel and your hair out the window
Now you know all there is to know about
I keep on lying, keep on denying
But that was long ago, now there's lots of things I know
clean off the stolen goods
Skydiver, short circuit just like a live wire
Y'all are really not stopping us dude
All you ever do is make mistakes
Die Nächte von Athen verge' ich nie.
Are you ready, Steve? Aha.
There's no one I'd rather be
What? You gotta make your money work for you
Brother, Ill be there for you
[Primo] Check this out though
massive hard on in here!
I twist my A hat to the side just for style
Get on the scene and then they turn into sinners
With my niggas when it's time to start taking lifes
Maybe it just ain't there
ho ancora i tuoi vestiti nell'armadio
Devastation rain from nation to nation
Put a little love in your heart
Lightning bolt strikes the horizon
Shoot off both your knees
La luce che tu dai
Out in the parkin' lot
So hate it if you must, but I made it and you can trust
I don't know much about you, not that I want to. Not that I want to.
Baby rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
(All you ladies in the nice tight ( ? ))
that I'm free, free to be me.
(I can't get through to myself.
Here we go, let's start the show
out, ya'll come in, the money stays in the car 'till I say
this, a love so strong
control me, I don't mind with you were dancing slowly
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
Dangerous in love with you
But you and I we've been through that
We gotta face the facts
Even though you might not show
I'm screamin' "fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas"
(I'll be raising ma swags some wanna be je 2ui gwonjiyong)
'please be with me for a thousand dreams'.
No matter what you order well I got it in stock
Monogram bags, Louis V. tags
we lived for gods we cannot see
You're just one of one hundred clowns
I'll be your saviour but baby I swear
And you will win my love
its funny how the years go by
She's been stepped on and walked on so many times
Es el fin, todos vamos a morir
(That's what all of my friends say)
And I trust it like the ground
That's why I'm moving on.
It all seems like yesterday like a bird, time just flies
Black, gold, hundred mill' off the floor
But you might as well stay, there's no limit to the sky
Honey, just allow me one more chance
It's a fact of life, don't you forget 'em
And last night I had trouble sleeping
And all the things we think of as eternal would come undone
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on
Where did the sunshine go why is it raining so
It's just another song about missing you
Talk and talk and talk and talk
So my standard break from life is in order
And I ain't over it yet
Her phone ring and you find out
The birthday girl is out of control,
The water's deep, cold and still.
And may all your Christmases be white
Make their livin' diggin' dirt.
There is a war going on for your mind
Jogeumssik nae ma eum tteolligo isseo
At my window with a broken wing
You think that will protect her from the rain
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' mad or too soft
And every thing all real fuck what you might can get
la noche yo y t la luna,
DJ Screw Rest In Peace, wuddup"
There's no way to escape it
Chain with the new bezel (chain with the new bezel)
and you'll have to admit
Nareul kyesok ppanhi chyeodabone (wo-o wo-o wo-o wo-o)
That's too new for me, I'm so vintage loaf
(Everyone) The human company draws close
I'm aware how much I miss her there
We try hard to give them respect
We're laughing at you, laughing at you, laughing at you, laughing.
but I showed the tabloids bogus passports
You could be the question killing me, or the answer that will set me free,
(Bitches) all in the (spot) go head (and get your) fun on
Nice so precise with a hip-hop update
Fuck it man, Gipp he got cellular of Ron's
(i was put here for you)
Tic-toc, running out of time
If you laugh or cry
But I don't think you'll ever find such emptiness
This is how the city-folk and mole-people connect-nect
Seen through the windows of Hell
And now I hope you're here to stay
Take the money and run
Body recovered on a Monday
When we go out walkin', we know what we're talkin' about
Then fly 'em up to the spot a pile of dust
And I've moved on from what we had
Evelyn I'm not coming home tonight,
Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears
Here we go. Here we go.
Singing with my clan at two moons or
Let the vision of it
Can't walk away when the pain keeps callin'
So you wanna be a rap/rock superstar, and live large
Will you recognize my soul, before we grow too old?
deranged nation that gave me the generation ecstasy under water, I forgot
Taste it on the tip of my tongue
I got no advice about anything
You're just way too much . "
Could scarcely scare us into quittin'
I'ma let life be my song
Oh what did I know?
And I know I got a big enough demeanor (Future!)
this feeling will subside won't choke me anymore
And I want out of here
Sinful! Still shorty putting the something on me
The only living boy in New York.
I don't need to be the hero tonight
They're only as big as
I'm comin' ta fetch ya, yeah homes I'll wet ya
Do anything to make me quake
[All] Light Light Light Light Light [Baekhyun] Woo Oh Woo Oh
I'm not sure of what I'm running from
But will you love me tomorrow
Lock you in the fucking trunk
Walked through the doors and the records stopped
I just wanted you to say
The count is three and two
Cuando llegue el nuevo dÃ­a
yeah, take me to your bedroom, I'm ready
Monday morning we're signing the lease
Just like we used to love
Pain like the rain that's falling
Broken hearted, it ain't a lotta fun
Let's move here we go
That I'll be back sometime this time next year
And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me
O hear the angel voices
A bleeding afterbirth of what was done
There is nothing I can't do when I have on my underoos
Must be the season of the witch.
One in my arms you know, one on my mind
You wanna make a memory
Tried to sell my soul but no one's buying
So many things I wanna know
Odori tsutsuke you! kagayaki ha moonlight
With your voice in my head
Do you feel my heart beating
A golden handshake for every daughter
Outside you draw, draw yourself
I will search the land and sea
And when I say shone,
The 1-87 will stop 'em
How you get to the club?
How precious did that grace appear
I'm a going down down down to the river
Tell me, tell me it's addicted to the same love
The demon dies by fire
Grand delusions of petty criminals; if I'm not everything I'm nothing at all
Can't stop this course we've plotted, oh yeah
You've got to show her you love her, morning and night,
I though you'd fade away
Looks like a job, job, job for, job for
A million empty pockets and niggas is building rockets
So yo, go on and get your nose fixed, Hump
Entrar y salir despacito en tu mente
No conscience speaking ain't nothing wrong
The boy lives in a high rise now, he's neighbors with the sky
If I can't find a way
Tellin' you how, pulling you down,
I just can't live without you, I miss ev'rything about you.
As it warms your face
I'm snowblind think I'm lost in space
Bring it Â­ SHUT UP! Nigga, sing it
But please before you go one thing I'd like to know
Yeah, I'm gone you see
(50 cent) Clifp the bye
But you and I are different
you were made for me (no more party..baby)
My rims chop chop, while the bass drop
Nu er det jul pÃ¥ Vesterbro!
It's good to be here again
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
[All:] Drop top down headed for the disco.
Crazy for you Mr. DJ!
gonna to it to you everyday.
Can't wait much longer, yeah
Giddyup baby . . . sha la la la la
You, like heroin straight to the heart
Many thoughts I'll lay, Many me cloned MC's talk but they all are sayin.
I'm not so laid back that I wouldn't try...Nothing Is Wrong
So Pegleg's going down in infamy.
You'll take a piece of me
ist ein sauber geshavter Drei-Tage-Bart
All my days...always and forever
The same old eyes but not the shine.
Bring back your love to me
More bodies being buried, I'm losing my homies in a hurry
Mientras a mi me vigilaban la puerta
I can't stop lovin' you
Well, everyone's got needs, but,
You're all that I've been thinking of
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere down the road
Oh I loved you baby
All begin and end with me
My little man, my girl
And the world is bringing us down leaving marks on our skin
Like the dumb brutes, who in a secret lair
Or a uzi, be careful who you choose, could choose a marvin, choose a ship
The mid-80's is what I'm talkin about
My friend, IT'S BULLETS FOR YOU
(Â¡Duro, duro!) Que suena "beautiful"...
Is really not my style
Not a game or a race but the stake is high
Go in and kill mom and dad
How we'll have grown so far apart
What if snitches all stayed in silence
Oh don't ask why, oh don't ask why
Life looks better when you drink away the pain
Hey Millie boy man you go ahead
I'll find a way to make it last
Guaranteed, leave your land, where you at?
I got all my cards in one shoe
let's go rolling in a broken winnebago
One more trip around the sun
Then you shouldn't try to front
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Vamos a ver seÃ±ores hagan el corrito conmigo que dice asÃ­
So much for happy endings
und Respekt an den DJ
But I'll keep loving you although you can't be true
Things that rearrange our brains make us think insane
The more that we discover
And take your chance right now
Wherever you get stacks, I'ma fix that
We dachten dat het kon
When your back's against the wall tonight
We've been talking bout Jackson ever since the fire went out
Due to blunt force trauma
You rippin' the bone like me, can get it as long as me
Esta traicin ya no poda alimentar la ilusin
They say you never care for me
The big disguise, they've led us to believe
"Yeahhh, head crack, head crack"
Well a preacher can't tell you _________
Okay, bun is on the mic, premier's on the track
Cause you got it goin on
Always thought I could get hurt pretty bad
And the kids don't get it cause soon as she get she gone spend it
He had such a short attention span
I'm fuckin up people's heads without speaking, without speaking
You're a lady, you're an angel,
modern rap history is re-born on cd code in the form of a poem
Don't wanna talk about it
I think I deserve the best
Because I have several vaginas
I bet you wan' it crunk,
And the air is thin
I'd tell you face to face if I could look you in the eye
Under the gentle arches we rode
Yeah, got rid of the other kids
Are ya ready for me
Sweep him off his feet, pull the trigger, let me sick him
Ya baby, Ya baby, Force dawg, Crysto, Ya baby, Force dawg, Crysto
You want it all but you can't have it
doesn't hang in the night
Ask around about me nigga, listen what they say
That time is good and gone
No one can make you loss your faith,
Dim the lights and hang up the phone
I want you to say that you understand
Living on my own, living on my own
There's a chance you can't deny
You've been gone too long, I'm waiting out the winter
but I'm the one that's getting hurt.
Guest he was my best friend, yeah, yeah, yeah
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
Don't you think it's time we think about you and me?
Insomniac, I don't sleep, I can't dream
Mi rubi la mattina che mi sveglio da solo e non sta bene...
There's just one more thing that I wanna do
Not just, not just getting by
When Jesus went down to the river that day he was baptized in the usual way
And hangin' out with the midnight faces
But my pride wouldn't let me dial.
I wish that my world was softer
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man
warm me in your latin fire
Making promises of love that never do come true
I've got a crazy mind
She's gone, yes, she's gone
And it feels so strange
Let me know, babe, about my fortune
The perfect enzyme is me with your brain in my other hand
Has lots of tattoos, and is all into rap
What if he was white
Wakin' up to the morning each day
It's like a whirlwind pushing in the deep end (x2)
The whole club was lookin at her
When we got shows where you're at, don't even show up
Played out of style out of rhymes
It don't matter to me
Seems he's lost some stocks and shares
[Junho] (Ha Ha) haru jongil (ni) ni saenggak
She doesn't love you she's using you to show you off,to her friends,
I can bring me like up all the way (Sure it's good)
The light, the light, the light, the light
You've been your loving was made for me
I can't believe I've fallen for you
Niggas gettin one deal in six months they poor
In her lifetime and for what?
GÉl, ey sÉhÉr... gÉl, ey sÉhÉr
i'm the brooklyn bomber that's gonna self-destruct
It freezes before it hits the ground
'Cause we roll like the sound of thunder
You're just on the edge, I think you're breaking
Make me a happy home
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And make me look like I'm another fool
I turned away to see her, Woa! she caught my eye,
There The Shepherds Bowed Their Heads
But now I'm hearing all these words you say
Let's hear the one about the Devil's Queen
it was such a beautiful thing to do
'Cause honey I believe what you said
I will always, always love you
Gettin money on my own pace
Give it time, things will get better
And when they light up our town I just think
And I'll tell you why
And a lazy hustler don't get bread
They want to see us, Bitches they want to be us
Is it real, cause you're on live
20.000 songs in my head and a toast to all the pimps in the world
Break this thing off clean and
I don't want to run.
You've always been so warm and calculated I owe you a thanks
I feel like a smoke, to start up a new day
Ever since you left I've been a mess
Crawling back to the womb
And I know it in my heart
treba da se trc'i po parkovima
Es que yo ya no se
Toketeku no wa futari no naka ni
Until you hatin niggas die slow
You hear my heart when I call, when I call
Baby, you're all I want
Una cosita aiy que te voy a poner para los pie,
It's no use I know
[Sojin] Yeppeuge nal bakkwojun majchwojun
You shoot from the heart and play by the rules.
Don't take me for a loser, 'cause I'm gonna win.
Working up along the western ridge
On a journey filled with tears and laughter
Andavo da Blockbuster, i film di serie A
O come let us adore him,
I took her to the yacht, for shrimp and steak
I could listen to you all day
I'll be falling asleep on an empty street
Girl you gotta get down
So we can stay like this forever
In love pool eyes float feathers after the struggle.
All night, all night, all night
And the best weed you never had, haha
He's got a Wednesday night canasta game
lit below and burning white
From depths of Hell Thy people save
Hey keep it on the mission
Beibi, beibi se on ohi
Dragons breathing fire, but friendly.
Come ringing in your silent symphony
Until death do us apart,
Believe in me, believe in me
Hello welcome to my table
From a crush of blushing brides-to-be
Who's gonna pick you up whenever you fall
You look as good as the day I met you
All by yourself there in your world of blue
Try to wrong my rights, try to right my wrongs
The good book, or even satan you see
Cette nuit enfin, tout est calme
Because it's our people that we thinking of
To pick her up at full speed
And now that I'm alone at home I hold your favorite cologne
But when I think about all I could win
da gerade der so aussehen mu wie ich heie."
Time after time, because you're mine
Longs a sweep soh till him lost one foot a shoes
I am not going to let it get to me
Yeah, okay, you like it
Wine like a yard woman, grind like yuh numba one
Bitch I got El Chapo on the other line
Integrating life lines carry on with your shine, shine
Draped in all designer everyday to walk around
Wo xin wo zuo ni de xin wo
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)
You'd think that I would have known by now
When the back of her, your so damn worked-over
And no one saw the pain inside
Up laid in they tomb
I've got a body of my own
So I, just walked on by
Girl you better tell em all
Out here in the midnight sun
Para pensar en ti, para pensar en ti
Die Welt ist ein Gerichtssaal
Or was it that the woman was never blind, and he was lyin',
You got to plow, plow to the end of the row
Motherfucker like me, hey, hey
Shit look like it 'bout to bite somethin' and shit nigga
Nuclear distress still want you
Cause niggas still want to buck wild and profile
hay cosas conocidas, tambien desconocidas,
A century of thirst outlasting two or three world wars and 100 year old beer halls that do not exist no more.
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
That could take Jesse James when alive
Wik ist er me mie gebeurd?
We might never go if noone else is watching us
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
Girl (girl), please (oh oh oh oh oh) give me your heart (your heart)
Boys will be boys it's a fact of life
I like the drugs that sail
Life's hard, I've always known that
In and out of love I wonder what I thought I was doing there
Noah can build his ark
Oh, yes, you mean and vicious the way you switchin'
We'll see you mother and dad someday
I made it easy to dance to this
You say things that I don't,
Had me speeding on this racetrack, furious
Put a bullet in the clip and come get ya ass
e quelle viceversa in queste.
But what do they know about puberty?
Sha, la, la, la, la, baby
Pulsing light goes to my head!
I just can't help myself (ahh ahhh ahhhh)
And maybe I'm a fool
Even your mama want my autograph
You wait for a sign to come
You're tire of waking up
Isn?t the world a crazy place?
I'm from that Jackson 10, hoe
And we're gonna get some
Is that your shape in the foam of the sea
Didn't know I loved her till they laid her down
It's just that when in Rome
Then cut through all the tension y'all invent with a chainsaw
And that without you I just, I'm gonna be lost
I think I wound up where she told me to go
(I tried these lines, I tried...)
Can you dig it (yes, I can)
Lead's bustin out of a old black Impala
Having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning
Society's clownhouse and everyone's a freak
He's out, he's safe, he's out!
Breaker breaker one-nine, Adair county for life
I can no longer bear this cage
Why you focused on all this dealing?
Can't stop, no I won't stop
Nigga you scared when a St. Clair nigga bust
SuÃ©ltame en banda mi hermano,
The world is burning in your hands
Divided highway cuttin' through the darkness
Does she give you her time
And I'll meet you further on up the road
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I can take your cares away if you just let me ease the pain
You were, all that I wanted
Up on banker's hill, the party's going strong
But they were lying we'll soon be dead
I don't know the reason
They threaten to tear me all apart
So I'll move on my way
I'm like, It's time to breeze, told honey, Let's leave
You've been feeding me lies
Jer i tvoje su zelene i snene,
world that we're living. the trust is not there with friends lik
Welcome Beyonce, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly, and Ashley
I used to want you so bad
I am fresh and clean every mornin'
It's all so big and twisted
They married, a dandy and a back alley tough
And the time will come
Drove 35 miles outside of town
I still think about you
When had quite the fight, me and my lovely wife
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
Yeah, Travis on the Drums
It burns straight through, but the devil don't mind
I don't have time for that
But had the same meaning
Snitches, let 'em point the finga
Una canciÃ³n que tus encantos elevase y, de esta vil manera
His oath, His covenant, His blood,
I can't feel this way, so ordinary
(uhuhuhuhu) Ontong ni saenggak ppuninde
Come back to me, it's almost easy
And it's scratching out my eyes
He was leaning and nodding
Con el tiempo mira lo descubrias
I never wanted the stars
How long have you been feeling sad and blue?
Would you light a candle against the wind?
The sudden motion made me skip now we're into a brand knew trip
I don't know what it is.
Thinkin' bout things and what I left behind
Flesh: kickin it at tha track, g
Tragic, twin maggots, I grew up too fly
And pick out the perfect memory of you
Don't count on me -
Way more than I've ever seen
But that's the reason why we kicked it and you know it's right
One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive, she a man eater
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Y la memoria del recuerdo
But everything's fading babe, cause you're all I see
Wenn ich denke "Es ist Schluss, jetzt liegt das Ende in der Luft"
Quick to capping picture snapping, paparazzi follow me
Qui nous sauvera? Personne, leur conscience c'est les tabloÃ¯d
Checking to see if they could find that transistor radio
I'm going to kiss you like you never been kissed
Took the heat of the sacrifice
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Over expression and rationed, assimilated temptation
We've all got our weak spots
I woke up early on a Friday night
And no more air in our breath
