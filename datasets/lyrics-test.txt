You're not allowed to use the car now.
I'm sure when there's evidence of a friend.
But I'm sure where I'm going.
I've tried to make it look like it wasn't a question.
I'm sending you a message to the seme.
No (yes) Yes (yes) Yes (yes)
You're such a waste (x6)
But I'm not gonna be able to fuck, mnd.
You'll finally understand what you've done.
Tommy Motolla wishes he could have traded his life.
I have a lot of things I've missed.
No one has yet found him - he's still weird.
I'm the one who pushed the swing.
You talk about the city, so you're drowning in toast.
Until I'm in my bedroom.
Mén onun, mén onun kÃ¶nlÃ¼nÃ¼ almaq istédim.
We're sleeping in our bed until morning.
You'll learn what to say in L'amour.
A new way to sway, or flow.
I have to reach out to you.
I'm sure the heart is still there.
He called himself a mad dog Ronnie.
I'm sure they've missed the whole place.
You'll have to give him a good time.
I've been fine since the beginning.
The brothers are tough on a criminal.
And I'm sure I'm fluffing him.
Keep telling the sweet lies.
Behind the Phantom curtains I'm smoking something I can't say.
I'm really lying, I'm like that.
And I don't have enough to describe where I'm in the house.
I've been one man for a minute and the world is clear.
"until he's home and I'm with him."
Pimpin's not easy, he's got to play his cards.
Watch the blood on the 18-inch screen.
I'm like "oh shit"
I'm guessing you're a prince charming prince.
When they were running the thugs.
With water on my knees.
He was arrested for murder and a gun.
I didn't see the magazine, I didn't see the TV.
We're looking for a sign here.
You've taught us to claw.
You're going to the bridge now?
Everyone has the right to live.
Hindi magbabago pinapangako na para sa'yo.
I'll take care of you.
The Sucker MC is on our way, then they bite us.
I have you covered from head to toe.
Pero siempre la final mezgár.
Love for revolution love love love.
"I've been begging everyone in my life," she said.
The way you'd like the other guys to do it.
Keep in touch until the end.
Take a cab to the next town.
You're a little rat, you're a bitch.
What would you do, Queen B?
But I'm smiling, I'm smiling, I'm smiling.
She's the one who's gonna be here tonight.
Oh, John, you have to turn it off.
I'm a refugee, and I'm taking it on myself.
No hay minera que pueda sera, no hay manera que tu regadio pueda ni robarme.
If you don't like the company.
Keep the information out of the cover.
When I'm dead, I'll be happy.
It's harder to turn around.
The deepest bass and the real high.
E sai che il sole muore all'orizzonte.
You'll never see what you don't see.
You're still thinking I'm confident and damn.
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't.
Clean gators on Sunday.
The hieroglyphics are for me, the jungles are for me.
We've been snowing in the city in the summer.
Follow the path of fate.
I'll always be with you.
I'll be home tonight.
You're gonna drag them down.
You can contact me on the internet if you're sad.
Jichyeo itdeon gaseumi dashi sumshigo.
Love's moving us around.
The smell and the smell.
We don't have it in our hands.
We have the future in our hands.
I'm the girl who's gonna make the dub.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
Only love can make such a memory, a memory like that.
We'll find out we don't belong to each other.
When a promise is never fulfilled.
They'll feed you to the sharks.
[you're dying too much]
I saw it in my life.
I've always been conscious of my birth.
They're not rich, but they have a lot of love in the house.
You're gonna cut me off [you touched my hand].
No one will go twice,
When will you leave me?
I pull Benz, I'm feeling the baby.
Oh, it's not going to be like that.
As the terrible sky.
Chicama, chicama, chicama, chic.
I'm not gonna love you anymore.
I'll build my own world.
I'm asking you to stay.
We'll start with the caviar, Don Parig.
Why do you want to shoot a sabre?
We don't have a better table.
We're not going to burn, we're not gonna stop.
He was crying for help, but he wanted to go.
Stop the shutters, open the shop.
I'm back on the road again.
Maalasin sut seinlleni sua vain oottaen.
It's about you, you.
So cherish the days we've been looking for caves.
And I'll share my horse, my hole, my wife.
I think the world should feel something like that.
Ever since I've been outside, I've never been inside.
I'm also dead with my pets.
You decide to believe it's too late for the way out.
Sure, it's definitely a hot mess!
And let the fear fall on the night.
I love you, but I'm not happy with your friends.
I'm gonna change, bequeat, like Billy Bigsby 'cause I'm the (shit) G.
I'm thinking of love forever.
Just show me who's the hottest.
With a lead leg full of lead.
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.
My family's pictures in the house where I was born.
We'll go through it until tomorrow.
Give us a bottle of Henny.
I'll hold you here for a minute.
I'm gonna make a name for myself.
I have so much to think about, so little time.
You're running away with my spoon.
It seems like we're going to have a bad weather.
I'm reborn, I'm a man.
She locked you out of your life.
With the last farewell, this long goodbye.
But it's the thing about hurricanes.
Maybe I'm younger, but I'll take care of you.
I can't take it much more than I can.
I feel like I'm a stranger in my own country.
You still think you've always been like that.
You'll be known soon.
It's a promise that our love will last.
Two hearts beating, to keep the fire alive.
Nas núvens te deixe com a luz.
You're thrown and the storm is raging, but don't forget it.
You're trying to make me doubt your mind.
Until we see the white horse.
I'm not interested in any love book.
When they tell you.
We've been young and foolish enough to be.
Until it's gone, nothing's real.
That bitch's gonna be pissed 'cause I'm not getting married.
Why can't I only see one eye when you look at me?
I'm tired of not believing it.
You really love it, do you?
Who's the one who's got the house?
Stand up for your rights!
Panocha, a ver, a diga de neta.
Ich habe mir auch auch auch auch a.
The plans we've made.
The real niggas are gonna pop, they're gonna drop the rhynoser.
A reverse algÃºn dÃ­a a separarón.
When you're making money, don't forget them.
You only use it once and it's gone.
Another: A big, broad-eyed fish.
You know you've got it, you've got it.
He'll break, he'll break, he'll break, he'll break.
But he's not alone with the fairies.
You don't have to be tall.
He's got his son lying there now.
That's what I'm holding for you.
Eu aprendi o bastante poder sorrir.
I'm not afraid to tell you the secrets.
How can I love you when you don't have a soul?
"I'd rather be dead"
Keep an eye out for Sal, don't you get in?
Listen and I'll release you.
I'm telling you how I feel and how much fun I had.
Leave the dust on this street.
Uh, when I ask, can I get a witness?
I've been trying to talk to you.
Because a nigger young as me.
But my feet don't respond to my feet.
I'll teach you a new trick on my skin.
I've taken the keys, the money's gone.
Living in shame and lies.
But it's not necessary to say goodbye to me.
The streets of the city are getting colder.
We're just glad we're here.
De chercheurs de perles fines de perles fines de perles fines.
Above the mountains, far from the sea.
Isn't that a fucking Impala?
If you want, you can do it.
How to love, how to love.
I have a tiger in my tail.
Now shine the light above me.
I don't know why I'm crying.
I'll see what you're really like.
I'm crying in my stomach.
You've been quiet in my life.
We have to start with our lives right now.
I waited by the phone and prayed to be picked up.
Don't be a fool, don't you trust anyone.
Then the penalty will soon be paid,
I'd like you back now.
I'm living to be able to live.
When you call me by name (name, name, name)
I'm a little lonely in this town.
Why the ones who have so much are so much more likely to be mad.
She lost in a dream of peace.
No more Highway 51
It's a little bit of a surprise that it's a little bit of.
I'm not braking, I'm going faster.
And play the Texas boy who plays the game.
You don't look for a lover like that.
But the dollar is still the same, the dollar is still the same.
What can I do with love?
Oh, but I've been planted with all the lies you've told me.
Love is the best thing in the world.
I'm not gonna live, I'm not gonna breathe.
You're the one who's saying the words are true.
Because the tide may change tomorrow.
Remember the days when it's never going to end.
Life in the fast lane.
You don't belong to my parents.
She said, I'm not even talking to you anymore.
You're a man, but you don't see it.
He's been home a lot of times, and he's not paid much.
"hey, you son of a bitch, "they said.
The best shit you see, my.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
But she moves like I want.
If I'm sure when it's going to be.
I'm interested in giving you more than the next guy.
You've disturbed my balance of mind.
On stage with a b-boy stance.
It's like MJ's prime, "Off the Wall" with mine.
Because the night belongs to the lovers.
I guess we have a problem.
The sun will be following the rain.
We should change the definition of love.
If you give a little money, you'll sleep.
But I'm not sure about this dance.
Come on, give me a kiss?
You're saying you're not interested in it.
Put your hands on my body.
Kiss your mom when she sigh.
As the night was dawning,
"what do you think I'm gonna do?"
What we could have been.
In fact, it's a little poisonous, so we're gonna get him.
When you're not home, you're not home!
He's got a big car.
You don't mean you're going to be as fast as I am.
I'm sure the hatred is the same as love.
I'm arching my back because.
Now she's married to that guy.
I've marked you as a lonely page.
Everyone wants to be my friend for a long time.
I'm on the speed dial, you know.
I'd like to have a little love on the balcony tonight.
Take me, take me, take me,
I'd like to have more of this.
Your heart is a big boulder.
No doubt it's not a question of whether it's true.
I only needed a little time.
Don't want to be a statistic.
To make me love someone new.
Hab-firm, wann ich wir wir wir wir wir.
If you think I'm not respected, I'm sure you're right.
En la guerra de la guerra en la guerra.
You want to go wherever you want.
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up!
You're gonna play his game,
But the world seems to be in a hurry.
We will make heaven a heaven.
We're gonna be a real millionaire jackass.
And buy you a better dress.
Don't worry, baby, I'll take care of you.
Maybe we'll find a reason for it.
I'm feeling your heartbeat.
Because I think we should be flying.
I'll take the poison and spit it out.
When I'm ready, I'll grow up.
Ella siempre está seguida a mi.
Everything's not lost, no matter what.
You know you have to die when I see you.
My father buried me ten feet away.
I'm back to the roots I've been.
The next day, the next day, the next day.
Pero que la loco es el amor está es la.
Las luces me apagan, I'm going to do it, no me siento bien.
But something's holding you down.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You don't even half of it when I say it.
When they're so bold as to say.
I'm sorry, but I'll understand.
Let's pretend the guys are hungry.
You're dancing with your baby tonight, cause everyone's gonna do it.
We were dressed as a ghetto boy,
If you want, I'll hold you.
Keep your praise, keep your praise.
You know it's going to be.
For more than a thousand years.
They only gave me Louisville.
Bennem lz s ittmaradsz velem...
Because cheating is better than guessing.
The wheels are moving back and forth.
Why Can't We Be Just friends?
I'm sure I'm happy to live my life.
She was here a minute ago.
He's selling a disc in a shop.
You'll tell me you're gonna kiss me.
Here's where we're going to be.
Who cares if there's no improvement?
I feel my heart beating with yours.
Ways - to the end of the dark.
When the trees began to sway.
I'm not selling drugs to the devil in the past.
I'm sure there's someone who will try to.
[Chorus - Ace Hood & Brisco]
I guess I'd like to go away with my life.
I'm not gonna hurt him.
How do I live?
Love doesn't have a price, but you have to know the price.
On the desert island, the sea separates me from the sea.
One song at a time.
Listen to the roaring of the fireplace.
You're something, but you don't have.
Kill them and you'll see them die, yeah.
If they knew who I was.
There are no signs of evil in the smiling faces.
How do I know this?
The guards laugh at my heart.
You can repay the one who let you down.
We'll see one day, and we'll see.
I've had enough, I'm just a man.
You're not gonna shoot a girl, you're gonna hit me.
They wrote a song for Wing & Willie.
I'm preaching a lot, but I'm really convinced of it.
When we're learning to forgive the hardest part?
I'm gonna burn you and I'm gonna sleep.
As if I was crazy.
No one knows what I'm going through.
When she was asleep, my baby was like that.
Ambassador Denn Rum ist keine Spiel mehr.
You're not gonna give me anything more.
I have grey in my head.
But I'm going to say you love me.
She's got more than I've ever had.
Read between the lines, they teach them to sing.
As a quiver of quivers, I'm quivering.
I went when I met John.
I have the desire and soul to go.
I'm not going to catch you.
We're going to the party, we're going to the groove.
Do you want to let it go?
It's a little harder than a little bit.
It's easy to see what's going on.
They're gonna put us back in the house, bitch.
Because he's not on your side.
She meant you weren't hurting her.
I'm sailing on a new beginning.
You've never seen anything more beautiful, but she won't make you cry.
She said she would leave them alone, but I'm a skater.
Di occhi, di mani e di malto.
Look in the eye and feel the world.
And I've learned that my loving husband is my husband.
Who's turning your way and seeing.
Doctor held me in his hands when I was born.
I'll pick peaches for you.
Grab me and dance with me.
It seems that the friendship is untied.
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God,
We're throwing shit like grenades in the air.
And he pulled the rebels to the ground.
Que nunca de la rolar la cosa.
It's a shame that there's a voice.
I'm still writing her, she's a mom now.
With the CIA's mole,
No one knows him, and no one cares.
I lost more than you'll ever see.
I'm going to the Speaker's Corner.
(Siente, siÃ©ntelo pa' arriba, pa' arriba)
Hey, I'm going to fall, I'm gonna fall.
I'm so grateful you know what to do.
You know you're not gonna be able to do it.
Then they're on your side.
I'm not gonna hold you.
You're the big fish in the world.
The celluloid is caught in every thought and gesture.
Sie ist eine scheisse um die Scheisse um die Scheisse um die Sche.
Kristian Till Jorden är kommen.
I'm not sure I'd see it so well.
Dad came from Detroit and he took me.
I'll wait till the hour.
You've made me the way I'm like you.
I'm sorry, mama, I thought of something (uh oh uh oh uh oh)
As before, every night.
When I'm just a minute away.
Nigger, where's the dollhouse?
Pero son of a tus ojos, ya lo ves.
And the baby Ra was left, O.T.
I can't tell you what you can't tell me.
Gasping for air, picking up a small blister.
Nigger, I'm gonna have the juice.
By the door of the old barn.
Oh, my God, I'm going to do it with a knife in my mouth.
I'm the one who's responsible for everything.
Friendship that's never gonna change.
Because I'm the one who's got the block.
The girls are going to be sooo gooey!
He's two faces, he's not on his head.
Kakehiki no imi sae wakaranak naru.
You better jump out of the building.
They're like ooh, they're like ooh, they're like o.
I'm not gonna fuck with you all.
Because we live in a time.
I have money, and I'm going to go.
I'm gonna throw a bit of whiskey and ash on my tits [smack]
Just let it go, it's okay.
I think it's the point to get there.
It's more than you deserve.
But you have to hold on to it.
I'm turning left, 'cause I hear something.
I'd like to call it a night, but I can't.
But who's the one who's missing a woman,
From the beginning, I've told you.
You're just like a society, too, cuz.
But I love you more.
We pay ourselves, we're on our white tee.
Just look, just touch me.
And the radio doesn't play it.
You're burning me with the fire.
The funk is flowing to the highest.
I'd be gay if I loved Shaggy.
When we're around?
Who wrote it in the diary.
The angels took us, oh, oh.
You're not going to go very far.
Sorrow on the roads.
Remember when I asked you for the number.
Between a boy and a girl.
When I'm thinking of all the suffering.
I'm never gonna get him.
Laughing like a red death in the dark.
Cualquier noche con mi cara está está est.
You know I'm really good at it.
I'm stealing your thunder.
Pero no está seguida está seguida.
I'm sad, and I'm crying, my dear.
You don't have my first love.
I'm a devilish, but you know I'm here.
Wiggle like a snake's wiggle like a duck.
Dass du nichts als nur ein Arschloch.
For the cold times of the past.
You're not gonna stop, and you won't stop.
I'm sure it's always been you.
It was cold and nasty, and it was right.
Give me more, more, more.
Some people think I'm crazy.
"may God be with you"
Do you feel like you've been cheated?
I'll go with you, sweetheart.
But I'm sweating, but I'm sweating.
Blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo, blo,
As the lights of the casino.
We've been crying for years, and we've been crying for years.
She said she was coming with me tonight.
I'm telling you, you're listening.
When the road is not going to change.
Take a minute, choose the topic and let it go.
Biological technical message view with no point.
I'm gonna beat you like a Tecmo Bowl.
I'll burn your skin like a fire.
Mamoru mono ga aru kara tsuyoku nareru.
I'm as hard as a rock.
As you, my dear, like you.
De los que seguida por la mar, por la mar, por.
I'm gonna get the gun, but I don't even know where I'm at.
Don't let me get in the way of you.
I'm looking for a rich guy...
You have to give me a little room.
Now I'm going to take you, but I know the.
I'm sure you're interested in me, uh.
I let the shit go in the club.
But faith doesn't know anything about reality.
Bird, everywhere I'm going, the birds are everywhere.
Even then, I was right, it was a cake.
Don't be so stiff, you better move!
I don't know what I'm sure about.
What if you've never had anything?
Why do they all go?
I'm not all together.
Throw them out and let them go.
When the cactus is ripe.
It's not your fault, it's not your fault.
If we're all together, we'll do anything.
I'm glad I've ruined the wedding.
The answer is in the sky.
I would have taken a great white horse and loved her.
I'll see you through me.
Rich man, poor man, you're either?
When I'm through Niggas, they never ask who the fuck you are.
You're supposed to tip her, you're supposed to tip her.
It's not going to be a problem.
If I'd opened it, you wouldn't understand.
You're still giving me hope.
Or will he lie under the clay?
For the gift, and the giver.
I'm going to the roll nigga.
Gamushara ni nanika wo sakashita.
She'll be free at 18.
We're going to the Sunset Grill.
Time immemorial, time immemorial, time.
He drank, flashed his knot, and he was gone.
I'm waiting for you to see...
But I'm not going to wrap my head.
Ir kitos kojos seks tave paskui.
They're staying up for the rest of us.
It's a talent that's kind of a talent.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
You can play me or you'll stay.
If the shred is picked up by the pick?
She's gone, your lost, now she's gone.
You're staring at your paranoia.
(Woof!) Te pase el rolo!
Now I'm thinking about us.
I'm changing my life for the girl tonight.
I'm not going home anymore.
They're full of shit.
Break it down, break it down, break it down!
And I'll be in your world forever.
You're definitely a great deal.
The boy put his money down, 45
I'm just a plant, I'm a plant.
I'm almost crazy about it.
I'm on a tight rope - I'm scared of it.
You have a lot of work to do, you have a lot of work to.
Everything in life is small.
Because the ride is about to begin.
I've been a fool since then.

Vuelve a tu pueblo otra vez.
I'm not playing any of them, I'm not playing them.
They've waited a long time for this shit.
She kneels in a puddle of reflection, and she's afraid it's the same.
I'll serve them better if I'm trying to do it.
I'll find her one day.
Every politician who has a dubious past.
We're all playing the game, you're just not playing the same.
In the silk of her thighs, in the hinge of her thighs.
You touch like a dangerous disease.
Grab your hands on your knees.
Don't let me down, please.
You drink wine, you make your ass move.
Pay the price and keep on paying.
The noise annoys 24 hours.
If you're really interested in it, you can show it.
I'm gonna hold you here and I'll be happy.
Nigger, nigga, yeah.
I'm sure you're just enjoying her company.
We'll all fall if we don't fall.
Give up and let's begin again.

You're never gonna sell crack when you're resting.
We went down the beach with my cousin Arthur McBride.
Another old prophet's on the fence.
The last three days have been...
Keep on with it, keep on with it, keep on.
I'll show you my bow and I'll show you.
I have signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours.
Smoke a pound of weed.
Living life as a free man.
So let's pretend and I'll believe it.
I want to make my wish come true, baby.
Because it's the last time.
You'll hear the 'Braat' as Birdman says.
We're reading when we're waiting for the bus.
Strange and distant, the end of the day.

It's a road, it's a road, it.
I'm just a number for the disease.
I'm looking for a way home, but I can't.

Because I'm interested in it.
I'm gonna give you more.

Maybe I'm not good, but I can try.
It's my opinion that something I didn't do.
But he thinks he would have blown our minds.
What do you want me to do with you?
Turn on the red light.
I'm not your shadow.

You'd have a ring on him if you had a ring.

You dressed like a priest.

Some people think I'm crazy.
Anyway, you're gonna make me.
