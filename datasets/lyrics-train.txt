Yeah, yeah, you know how me and you do
Your arms are open for me
So far at least until tomorrow
"If they ever drop the bomb," you said,
Show me my favourite beauty spot
Everything I ever had to lose
And I promise its going to kill
There's no clothes to wear
And people on the streets
She a callin out to meet mi wife and mate nuh chat
You my babe, I got my eyes on you
Really, really, really, really, really, really, find me
But to moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
Got a hold on me like I'm hypnotized
Gonna do (Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)
Porque a pesar de la distancia nos siguen con ansias
Oh, I'm the befo', but Da Brat is the after
And walking in the dust again
Then maybe we should all be praying for time
And I'll always bleed for you.
Oh standing in the shadows, the shadows of the big man
Read those boys the news
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
Knowing that I got her back with what's important
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
You gotta hit the road
If you have to let it go,
You said cities will fall
And I know it makes you cry
Except the closer you get, the better you look
And I wonder where you are
Marunong maglaba kahit wala sa itsura
And she love to slurp it up 'til the semen's gone
In the good ole USA
That I should look for someone else
See you big money, I'll turn 'em to chump change
A wanted man in New Orleans
It's just the ground I'm scratchin'
Bad bad boy, a bad bad boy,
Let the church, let 'em say amen
With broken wings I know I'll die
you might as well shut ya mouth
Feelin embarrassed and baby I was straight up walkin in truthfulness
(I don't like you, go home)
there is something going on
It just ain't fair that it ain't right
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?
My love will guide you
Searched for you almost everywhere
Don't know what to call that
My heart is all in tatters, I ain't nobody's saint.
I need to make a brand new start
The heavy heat gettin' out of hand
I was just doing my job, maybe so was he
You are here for a reason
There's only a fool there
Look, I know we been friends for a while now
She packed up her suitcase and walked to the door
(But somethings gonna come around)
Is hope that you will hear me sing
Young man, you too girlie girlie
And I know what to do when
Yea, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof
To catch that drop of wine.
AND THIS COLD GLASS OF BEER I JUST PAID FOR
You say you're sorry, say you're to blame,
Or make a sandwich of us both but the bread is too stale
Chance to dig each other
Keep track of visions in my eyes
But the way I feel you, I doubt it
Think of the good things, remember the bad.
I get harassed mostly everywhere I go
I'mma see you when I see you any day
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
So free wherever we are
Call me and I will come and fix you get your feet on
Ya never wanna see the sun go down
We got the buzz and the want you, baby, all we need is a little more time
Since I started eating my motto is eat away
Er bekommt ein' Helm aufgesetzt
Right now Im in Europe fu*king up sh*t
Tan solo estar junto a ti
Got to let it go.
I think I like today
later, all of you haters gonna catch vapors, you don't wanna test.
My dog Gaho is more popular, my gestures are like hypnosis
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
Lights are green all is go
Cada abrazo un laberinto que..nunca deshare
They see us they hatin'
Respectfully i see to thee
And the wild birds all warble
Anywhere around me when I fall
watashitachi ni asu no jiyuu to
I can hear the leavin' train.
Ist Smu im Haus wackeln die WÃ¤nde jeder Halle
It's time to take it back now
should i stay should i go
I eye eye eye eye eye eye eye oh yeah
But oh, those lonely nights.
Rest your head here, feed our nation for us, please
And diamonds are a girl's best friend
Communicatin cool with them country folk, strictly
Iceburg-5 - where you at??
To the place, that we shared
where you thought you could fly
Ja, ek het die shit, my bru, hierdie shit is die shit
But little girls and daddys cry with teardrops angels cry with roses and with rain
I've been sitting here (sentado aquÃ­)
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',
Di likkle fool fool bwoy cross out and mi in di place yuh know seh mi a shine floss out
A collect phone call, the lobby's bare
Got a spot that gets me hot
So I write you back and count the days
Then I'll take care of you
But there will come a time and you'll regret the way
And he'll take you down
It aint a problem, I can picture us
Breathing life into your lungs,
I've come too far to get jacked and ?
You should already know when I walk in the door
I don't care (about time)
To hear a couple words of mine
Red eyes itchy both day and night
[Yoo/All] Catch me if you can
We don't give a fuck!
You are my love ... (fade)
Im gonna pack up all my problems and ill leave them right here
And if you bend over far enough we'll make this country number one
I was layin' in bed
You left the hills behind
You're making this way to mathematical
I wanna be good to you
There might be times when you start to think too much
The building turned it's back ignored my call,
Dilated peoples, alkaholiks, this joint's right on
And if you find a love that's tender
If it's not too late for coffee
How many shells stuffed in my closet?
Well those in the know would have you believe
Esto es vida, esto es vida, esto es vida
Take me I'm all the man you'll need
My 8-track's pumpin' out a country song
And if you not in a hurry and me is to get you
We, who gets conflict, must just be weak, it's gettin' clearer
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
And ghetto teams packing heat like its legal fool
So punk is dead and this is so new
I can see the resolution
We got our hearts dipped in time release
Don't you tell me that it's over
Somebody wants something of nothing you had
Push until you can't and then demand more
You ride and flow from my head down my neck
Keeps you standing on your feet
Behind an open door there lies a million more
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
Here was where the money laid
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
It was all that and more
Til' the rain pours through the ceiling
Joy, it's such a joy
With no tricks the fix comes with dope fiend precision
She had no fear of death.
It ain't no secret I've been around a time or two
God knows, man, he's not tellin'
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
People were stunned, everyone's waiting
Oh, just let me go
Come the day, you return my love on hold
while your alone in your bedroom,
I said that life (sweet life)
Wir sind nicht aus Berlin,
so I scream again again again
it's our fate, now it's late, you look great
The raps that can ride these beats (I got to have it!)
I cried to the river
All the cool dry air alone.
Girl you really ought to think about it
Oh tell her I will wait, if she names a date
A nigga think this is a disease, can't even keep it a 100
Puede ser (Quiero ver lo que tanto soÃ±Ã©)
Cause I don't believe in you
So we gon' let everybody see your gangsta ass get smaked like a bitch
Get rid of that clown, Get with a factor
Catch a player leanin' impa-uh, one up in the trunk
No one else cares to hear the sound of Faith coming near
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Down at the river, we're doing fine
'Cause there's magic in this building tonight
And I'm so lucky 'cause I found a boy like you
And make him tell me which one is the more fair
Let the holy rollin' dance begin
Saw you there on the barstool as I walked in
For telling them dirty lies
Most of us only care about money makin
She's the one thing you don't understand
When the waves of the sea die to the wind
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
Baby get on this side
Yeah, leave me back home to my trance
There's a time and place for change
You warm me, day by day
Cause I dont think Im capable of changing
Oh my rocket, oh, oh
A paradise untouched by man
Baby, what do I do to make it right
Bent in the Caddy Coupe me and Daddy Duke
With You All Night Long
Just soft boiled eggs in shirts and ties
They shall rot, they shall rot
Dig it out now, Ooh
Les rÃªves que l'on traÃ®ne
Caressin' on tha world main
Now you're not an eel anymore
We play on his ribs like a xylophone
And, let the songs of the Lord
She's cold to the touch
Skin like a code, first time for nothing you know, we're going to live till we die
In the night, till the light
But many people still believe you!
And you heart'n soul is what I came for
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
As our love for each other respects
Niggas think this Swisha Sweet
We're gonna go where we can shine
Where will this lead to
'Cause who you are, what you say
I walk the streets in the dead of night
Ay yo Rae I got this
todo lo robaste de mi
My anger has acheived a sort of permanence
Broken glass of a language
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
It brought an end to me and you
In the wee small hours of the morning
You don't have to like my band
Geisha girl suffer many times a fool
And I will be your nights
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.
And I feel so weighed down
You know I won't fly away
Oh fare thee well my own true love
You say you love me (x4)
Has it turned from a lifestyle to a fucking trend?
When suddenly i smell the popcorn
Dream of Horses, Dream of Horses
gone with it)getcha sexy on (go ahead get gone with it)
Wir sind Beginner fÃ¼r immer
A song, a song, high above the trees
We'll have a sleepy time time
Garbage trucks and taxi cabs don't seem like they can reach me here
Look at me when I rock with you
We play our music like a storm
I want you to love me
I'll keep my hair fixed, keep rocking the hottest outfits
I've been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Klop op mn deur, breng een fles wijn mee en drink op ons grote geluk
Now that it seems like
This is no place for the young man
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
Would you believe that yesterday
And all my jury is expensive
You will be at my door
Both of us hidden from view
She had an obsession with me
Cubrete guey! o te mato
Bm yellow blue c#m fishes of the g sea f#7
I was, I've been, and I'm gone
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
Y ahora que no te tengo cerca
When I shouldn't even care at all
I'm standing here with my four men
You can't unbreak our broken leases holding on to broken pieces, so return them!
But when I looked away
When he wraps up a package of peace for the world
Read a few lines, ah
(You're gonna miss) you're gonna miss your little honey some of these days
And tried to make me forget where I came from
pÃ¤Ã¤tin et aikuisen ei tarvii heitellÃ¤ tekorahaa
Do you want to talk about it with me?
For the brass bed I recall on the farm
Die belkeit hat mich jetzt eingeholt
Never been such a fool for love
Lieder nach Lieder, Reggae bis Heavy-Metal
but I wouldn't meet you
Cause I can, can, yes, I can, can
Baby don't go, you got the wrong idea
Tell me what you're thinking
Now you want a star, but I just think you should know
Gozando en Columbia, Venezuela why la Bahamas
Kiana told Deb, on the moped
Moan baby when we bone it's on
Just for the day, ay
Si algo te puedo asegurar
For a little while longer!
Gott, was hab ich bloÃ getan,
The homies down for whatever, we stack the chedda
You the troop get money it's yours
Is there a way to see tomorrow
I'm gon' make it work, twenty-eight and tryin' to get baptized
I went a little bit below her belly ring
It unfolds like a rose in your hands
Beat it up like Rocky
Dre is chillin', Ruff is chillin'
Ich sagte, ich steh' dir bei
He's got a slow, slow ride
Motherfucker I ain't got no love for some fake ass wannabe Donald Trump!
lay ya head on me
His skin tight hands, without seggs
We know where we're going, uh
Now you know we're on your side, so don't worry,
Avant de lui porter secours, ils sortent leurs iPhone 6S?
Haile Haile I, Haile Haile I
Cutting and pasting headlines of the papers
With your head above the clouds
Every night I heard my Mama pray
You got soul, you got class, you got style, you're bad ass
Alarms call the shots, even after you're gone
'Cause dying is living without you, here
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this
En la cara de esos muermos sin corazÃ³n
(whenever the rain falls down)
Fresh weed in a glass jar playa,
That old men talk about for years to come
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
Got the notes that you sent me
House what do you want another one for?
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same
I'm on the screen projected
Well I just called yez up
While we're brave enough to care
Mack, chop your rhymes like I chop, shop, chop a ACC
Dust in the sands, you've been sending
Seep in to my bones
Na na na na na na na
Even my hood call me baby Malcolm X
I will be soakin' up the sun
Hey what were ya thinking
Sometimes we doubt and argue
(Tupac) hey, you know LA is up in this
When you cast your spell you will get your way
Spend that shit, spend that shit
I was lying in a burned out basement
A hole in the sky
Case they have to pop one
We are two brothers forever in the dark and light
Can't be done like tryin' to find a penny in the sea
Things can work out for us
And I disappeared into the darkness
Like the last one I adored
Could tell by the way she walked
I don't deserve to fall this way, by a man who felt betrayed
will get you all that you need.
Some rather die, then face a fate worse than hell
and I dont know the reason why nooo
Threw out the girl to
Hey you, the jury members
You smiled so coy and you moved in slowly
The riot of your time
It seems more and more, what we're looking for
Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
Some men collapse at the racetrack
You will save the day
And sister pain is with me too
C'mon Skeletor, don't you wanna see me work it now?
I know you had to go
Looking for us? We over here
Until I'm sure that you're the one
Ridin on the train, I'mma whip a Benz in the rain
Can't show us where the cash is
Maybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect
It's all right, it's all right.
Couldn't do it by myself, got some help from Colt Ford
Bound to explode up in the heat
Oh kau bawa aku lagi sampai ku hampir mati
Ah, you know I told him to
It won't let me go this time
We can catch a matinee, if that's what you like
She's sick of being tired and tired of being sick
that tear at our backs like thistle down
Every time you go away, I always say
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried
What's the solution, to stop all this confusion?
They don't know 'bout me and you
you say this love will see another day
But you was wrong, didn't know about the big long
And it's too late now, to put out the fire.
Now that the dream is gone, developed, disguised
Back in the block, they use to try to play her
Stories that would make your eyes
Look at my emptiness, does it really show
But girl you can find me, yes you can find me here
They say the closest thing to freedom is livin' on the road
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
The sooner that you know, the sooner the shit flows
Life's got a funny way of showing
I was a one-line wonder in my own love song
I'm just a girl with a microphone
Yeah all that stuff you don't believe in
it's so sad, it's too bad
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
Who said you could keep this heart of mine
it makes it hard to believe.
Tears from my eyes when I remember
Free, equal, successful, way ahead... for what
Niggas know I exist only to wreck
I can say,I can say,is the something more that
Se lo das al chico, cuartetero
What will we do to become famous and dandy
Lost in my senses and I'm losing sightâ¨
And the hoe was like
It seems my own lies are becoming true
At Any nigga out to stop ours
My sense of humor might have narrowed with my age
Bringing the drama for the masses
Your empty bed ain't no crystal ball
How... can I trust in you?
Way up in the sky
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well
Is the answer up above
apart from tears and hate
Que la decision que di
There it is, there it is
This is the last time
I need you like the winter needs the spring
You used to be so kind to me at first
When we danced she held me tight
A face to erase what you find
Like the sun when it's dawning
I can breathe for the first time
Finally I'm where, I'm suppose to be
'Cuz I keep winning and these boys keep losing
But you can't put your arms around a memory
you don't matter to me anymore
love me through the eyes of a child
It's too late to look back.
Now I know the reason why these ads all look alike
A love that's really real, the only love that's truly true
I'm gonna be the best me
Taisetsu sugiru nakama ni natteru ima wa
Waiting to put a foot in the door
Real crook, you would think I'm some type of Bush
Ten thousand men on the move,
It hurts my eyes to see the change
I took a part of you
Yes, I refused to see the signs
But I'll take her back again
Would that get you off?
But the feds gon' bust you if your money too husky man
Stay hungry, feel the fire
'Cause there's nowhere left to hide
Trials and tribulations, critical situations
And fall into my arms
I got you under the spell
but the last wall standing's fell, daddy kicked it down.
Every time I hear that song
Now we're thinking we could get a good place to play
Ya esto no es multiplicar
I prefer to spend my time in solitary ways
I'm a body frozen, I'm a will that's paralyzed
Now I can hear that tick of the clock
Nigga gotta find a way
I'll think of her (think of her)
Can't you feel me running through your veins
And everything is blue for him and hisself
Finally someone said something good
Can't take the weight and I can't take the strain
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
But I never gave up hopin'
Sin ti soy una flor que marchita en el tiempo
I bet if im thrown money that body gonspeak
Only on camera, only on camera
Let's make this moment last
Man that ain't no lie
Ive seen the worst of you too.
So hang on to your dreams
Seen her dancing on the Sunset Strip
I just took my two sleeping pills
It's time to set ourselves free from the hate
Under her sweater and before she
I'm thinking up something to say
Set it off from your left dog
We might just break can you hear us trying
You know how hard it can be
Djame saber si adems de ti y adems de mi no suficiente
I had a dream... that we could do whatever, whatever we wanted to do
You just do you and ima do me(all day)
Find em, fuck em, split em, forget em
My people done left me behind
We go it brand-newÃ5 feeling
How much I love you
This is the last time
Saw 50 cent and he told me create a homicide
Oh I don't care ë ë©ë¦¬ë©ë¦¬ ëìê°ëë
All I need, all I need, all I need
I ain't talking bout the app no nigga in this city come hang with me
I'm looking to spread my wings and party,
It's been a year now, I can't wait
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
Heads quick, youre little chick, that deliver get a little glimpse at a
Watching my nirvana crashing to the ground
Like the members of the military who are now inflicted with gulf war syndrome
Nobody ever told you it would be like this in the real world
But there's nothin' I can do
Together we can come for the world, I need to know
Just give your heart some rope
There's a bar in far Bombay
'Till the day he was taken away
back it up then smack it
But only if you go with me
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
seiya kumo ya misae hiruku juu
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
Hangin' from the ladder of the chopper
Not watch someone's blood just spill out
To set this place aflame
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!
He at a nice hotel right by a festival
When your feeling down and out
Limousines and big lear jets
Prayers couldnt save her, she died a day later
Now I've got so much to say, so much to do
Do you seem him when he's coming and going?
I don't know if I'll die laughin'
In that narrow hallway of downtown
So I tried to touch the sun
As the hell that you know
So don't be actin' surprised when your daughter
There is no reason for you to hide
I made this bed I'm crying on
Getting to it, let's just face it
Settled for silver how could I know
And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright
We've all got a story frozen in time
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,
Bet you're thinking my life is so cool and complete
I make your life complicated
So we can get with the models
Lunatic smokin loops, loose in your sector
Just hold on we're going home
I'm not over you, are you over me
Damn that shit Fu (aye)
Two days in a row, finally left you a note
while you're running in the darkness
Choose life, the way that it's true
I just hope you write your thesis
Fly high, Flipsyde and evolution..
Call her a bully, she'll blow up your whole damn playground
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
Du magerst ab, bis auf die Knochen
Wussup wit the love, wussup wit the love?
When you call my name (call my name)
How does it feel to be in love
And all my girls in the super store
You can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
I learned all I know
e il suono che vibra senza sapore
She don't know that he's the greatest I think I really love him I do
Never one to say that I am just a little boy
And they got doggies screamin' on a chain
Pack your things and then drive south
Uh, that stuff you cook
Shell sheezie, ask my nigga b neezie
Girl I'm just bein' honest
You don't seem like you care
But it seems like I'm just predisposed
Baby girl I wanna get in ya head (My head?)
But I don't know about that
You can keep your bankroll, I want control of my soul
Say yes, I will, yes, I can
Vom freien Flug ber das Meer
You have poured out of grace
Mama she a sufferer, papa he a sufferer
Down and down, the youth descended
Yelling mo murder with the beam got lots of felons
Should you want to cross the line
Ha da da dee da hada hada da da (oh)
'bout any girl like I feel for you
The heat on my hip
She might sting you, and ain't no tellin' what that stinga bring you
When it seems a book burning's in perfect order,
And I beg your disease
Why t? mi amigo inspiras mis pasos
I guess it doesn't matter anyway,
sono koe mo yume mo watashi wo hanarenai no
But then a voice says, "bags that can't be stowed
Who do you think you are?
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing burn, burn, burn
Yeah, I'm having it all, your black summer
What it's like to be totally lost in love
Es que no hay forma de olvidarme de tus besos
Come closer let me wipe away your tears
I can't find the time to free myself from going down
Should have killed it from birth
And I really don't see why it happened to me. Wasn't there a better way an other day?
Why should the devil have all the good music?
Da da, da da da
I'm just about out of my way back to you
United we plan as a united front
We're just 2 honks & a negro
And I write my own verso
Every sweet thing that matters
You are so perfect, I just wanna look into your eyes.
And drop the somethin' somethin' on me...
Does it take an amputee to raise and arm?
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back.
I take and even laugh
I'm the one, numero uno
She smiled and said if you are who I think you are I'd really like to meet you
To take us deeper inside
That's when you turn away
And I've waited for her for so long
Say that you're gonna go
There is just one moon and one golden sun
Lay your head on my pillow
Go to the movies get the Rolos
Get down on your knees, and keep your trap shut
Lluvia de una estrella es tu luz
SO PLEASED TO MEET YOU
Who tells you what to do?
Well I'm an alley cat, some say a dirty rat
Life as a precious gift given from God
Now at Christmas time everybody will sing
Cobwebs and apple cores, old ghosts and vestiges
Gone are the feelings I want to show
Baby you're the one for me
We dance in the streets
No more people in my face that's not sincere
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
As I lay here by my woman I know I'm back where I belong again
Rock me goddess in the gentle arms of eden
Okay I'm still alive! So am I too! You cant kill a spirit even if you tried to
I don't want to live in a palace
Been careful not to lose ourselves
Don't care when you go
When the door is open wide for you. (Oh)
Amongst all these fuckin' shellfish...
One in Russia, one in China
And that no way for me to get along
I've got a strong suspicion
Fire code (uh uh uh uh)
Mein Kopf ist endlich wieder klar
My lungs take in the fragrance of remorse, what is the cost, am I living,
But still, I don't stop to the beat
'Cause they'll lead us to hell, but we'll all live to tell
five words is all it would take
Na na na na na na na
Can you save, can you save us?
Ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri- rip your dick off
I don't want to have to go out
Lifting up off the ground
gang rape revving engines overheating boiling up exposed and bleeding little boy
ein letztes Mal die Kpfe schttelnd liegen
now they wanna show me titty, cuz Im partying with Diddy now
And it's just so amazing
You come walkin' through town
I know the finish line's in sight
All the engines too loud, all the pavements hiss
Cause can't nobody call, tomorrow at all
But then I used to love her but it's all
Kneeling at the hotel reception
Sugardaddy's blowing kisses from his gun
...King without a woooman baby
aller Sekt wird nur noch Selters sein!
When we get there we'll never leave
We won't talk about the past
And it makes me sad, to be surrounded
Que yo te espero aqui, te doy mi vida por que vuelvas
Ser's un ayer que viva en mi mente.
It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turn style
You thought you'd keep me coming
Turn around you're a young wife with babes of your own
I been passin' everythin' in sight
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
And our eyes gazed in foam beer gogles
and mine is still waiting
Don't you know you're not lovin' by the rules
Listen up to what I got to say
Promise I'll never be defiled
The whole world is shaking now, I can feel it
Who writes the rules, who's got the master plan
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain
Blow it into the ash
She says, "hope: the belief that loved ones will never die"
Fuck you bitch, I hate you bitch!
I want you, I'll get you in the end.
Blue moon and yellow sky
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
The timings right, are you satisfied
But Marty's got the price to pay and Jimmy's gonna let her
All I know is nothing can stop us now
Just after you kiss her
By a man who takes for granted all he has
'cause enough of your love
I noticed that your ass too big for your draws
Unless I decide to step inside of that cafe
Must I say some more you weighed a buck 04
I drown in an ocean of perfume
Determination is a vital part of me
We've been in this band
When we have wished upon a Blackstar
Welcome home said the hot moonlight
You don't, you don't want these problems (I tell em), you don't want these problems
The peace in my mind is drowning, fading down
I know you don't want me anymore by the look on your face
with the sunlight in her hair.
With her heart on her sleeve, once in a while you're
Headphones cell phones transfers passes
Sei tutta da disinnescare fai moirire beggio tu.
Still down till I'm down, watch me act a damn clown
Oh, the one that you gave me anytime we were face to face
Fuzz get on me tried to test me arrest me
Well I know I shouldn't smoke
Travelin' man, love when I can
Reminds me of all the good
She wont even miss you.
They gave her one more day
Son mentiras, mentiras nada mÃ¡s.
Am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes
And we hold it just for the moment.
Listenin' to the billboard knock
You cast the darkest shadow
Yes, she too hotta, tell man she too hotta
Con el racismo hay que acabar
One more chance, we can make it right
You won't be fooled, by this
Neva' lovin' these hoes that's for my niggas dem
Well you was chillin' with your girls
Until my eyes cry out
Let the four winds blow
New sneakers, pockets way deeper than yours
You cover yourself you cover your skin
A nigga with a motherfucking gun
One night I will be a star
Oh, but may I work the mills
I'm still in love with you.
And I know you were feelin' it cause
Y no ayuda a despegarme de aquÃ­
Why, why the fuck you came
Temptation it's just a word to me
You say ah one for the trouble two for the time
Ive crossed so many numbers out
All your talk is cheap skywriting
Now I see you've broken a feather
Where it's easy just to see your own face
I can't go anywhere without
Make that ass clap everytime that I hit it
You're out there all alone I wonder why
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Don't you think it complicates things
I lay my head down on fine linens and satin
i wont predict it myself!
As soon as i'm done countin' up my ones, we can play
Tryin tah change for em juss say fuck em we dirty
I got a vision of your face
Snitches aint real 'cause dey lie so come wid a better lie
Cruisin' is made for love, cruisin' is made for us
I can sell my body if i wanna
Because you're all I have, my boy
you were over the edge
Know we have our little days
Think you wanna see us then go and join the line
Still want to freak if the ice wasn't bright in the masterpiece?
Like a whirlwind (Like a whirlwind)
Ayy, I'm in love like the Carsons baby
NO BADDA TELL IT TO NO BABYLON
Oh no I need to get a box of rubbers
With a truth in your heart, we'll make a fresh start
And baby I knew it
If you're looking for a treasure hip hop is the right soil
Caught a wish and got bitches in France
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine, ignition sequence starts,
Got your own apartment, a sports car too,
Don't take your aggression out on me.
May be a long time 'til you get the call-up
You and me, we live a life
Of breakdowns and one horse towns
Ya nadie puede ya nadie puede
You're out playing golf for the day
Like your last guy (I'm better)
Not one, not two, but three turntables
Macht es ihn zum Mann?
He says, 'My darling, you're the one I'll drape in sable'
Bet on you, bet on me(? )
Is it Buddha, Jehovah, or Jah?
You can hate me or love me
Oh what a woman she treats me uncommonly good yeah she does
I have no choice but to be all alone without you
Niggaz that don't ride right
I feel fine, I'm gonna' shake it, Lou
I don't want you but I do desire you
I can never get it right
She can not say the words they need,
He says you know what I like
Maybe your voice maybe your mind
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
Red lips, blue eyes and sweet disguise
You say you know her
And there is a way to go
And the thoughts that i'm havin r gettin me really freaked
Hit me when you get home baby
I want to be you
Blame it on the boom boom
Bored bored bored, rich and bored.
She's not your friend, that girl
And I still believe in you and me
I'm takin the pick up truck, but I left a little bit of money,
With a packet of goat's meat and a change of clothes
Visions of love forever in my mind
[Fat Joe over "Joe" sample]
I can help you anytime
the moment I'd no longer fight
That you know will be waiting
Hater, what you looking at?
Getting high and dry and I do it all the time
R: Je fuis comme un voleur
They remind me of the stupid things I've done
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
I love my baby yup yup
There's so much I could say
I heard she's got a 9 to 5 (yea yea yea yea)
'Cause Da Shinin went gold but you've been falsely told
You'll be in my arms again I know, so
And I hope that he's a friend
You're my brightest morning star
It's that YoncÃ©, your YoncÃ©
He rewarded her amply with a full beard
Oh, give me more like before
Like home between the cheeks
I was in love with the Stones, no satisfaction
And can you feel the love tonight
What's a drag race? Can't you see those dragons
Homie when you dropping that?"
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
Words only you would hear
Gettin beat up ain't no fun
Kenti akbar ghalta bi hayati
And you can bask in the mist, emotion bliss, desire's going round and round
spark it up and numb me on and off again
Say why you`re so hold and fly
Wait till it's over now
And the bridge is gone
The rain is pourin', we got work to do
But you've felt this way all along
I'll be the mad and the bad and the dangerous and oh
The magic of your hand on the drum
Lost and frantic, new age romantic
and as i was slowly closing my eyes
Just look into my eyes
I'll give you my love but it won't be true
Plus I know what they want
Meant to be free, born to be wild
Don't none of y'all niggaz want to fuck with us
And I'm not doing this alone
We-we-we sound and tell the people
as i approach the precipice
Pelican brief these niggaz on who I be
He must find a place to be still
You make me feel like an angel inside
Tra, tra, es cuestiÃ³n de bacilar
the rumors of your demise (oh my! oh yes!)
Every night he sleepin' by this stank bitch
Tengo mas anillos que Ginobili
All you left behind was everything.
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
'Cause that's the way she was born
And I'm so laid back cause I smoked a phat sack
I'm demented and deranged, motherfucker
I pass the mic to Mr. Shift.
Words are straight from the start
Now all through high school I relied on drug-smugglin
She hasnt made a call, she must be thinking it over
And a very exciting girl
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
It's all about money, It's all about mo' money, and it's gettin mo funny
Will you be there when I wake up?
I feel it back in my bones
and no one would inform me
We gotta save, we gotta save
And I could always depend on you
Broken and desperate before Her Orphaned Throne
He's real cool but he's not the same
it gives and then it takes
You're not livin' in my whirl-wind
Years ago my heart was set to live, oh
Oh boy you should have thought about that before
Losing faith, you're falling from
I left school at sixteen, tired of the routine, money is what I need.
In the precious blood of the Lamb
All we need is the good affection
With the things you're doing
And on this frail side, nothing else could be so real
Fate could never keep you away from me
So I stuck to the running
Collect the dough at a show as you sip the Mo'
You know the part where we come unraveled, oh
It's gonna get ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
They come out of the blue sky
What can feel so good bring you so much pain
Of meeting you that September night
Head's full baby, but you can't stop taking it in
Reload, shots at the sky, boo you watch a mole
"Tell me, does this hurt you?" said the faceless man
That's how I am, I only know you
And I pray for us
Yes it feels good having it real good
Got my feet on the ground so when I'm on my back, my head's to the sky
Do you read what they're saying about you?
The day you stop loving me
So prove yourself to me
They had to let me go"
You're talkin' dirty to me,
And then you hate it
Ride on my rocket ship, hey, hey, hey (2x)
When you hear that whistle blow
Pass me the bottle, pass me the wine,
So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
This is torture to me
Feel something again rahk rahk rahk rahk rahk rahk
y yo, y yo, y yo, y yo, y yo,
we let it slip away
Check one two, check two three
But you don't want to sing along
I fought to keep u in my life and this the thanx I get
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
And under covers you my muthafucka nigga,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Take the dive and wear the scar
Guns and shots, runs and drops
Got the Jumpin' Jack Flash
Gives some point to the cries
a passe pas avec le temps
Te pares let me love you
Oh my, it's time we found a way to
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop
Yeah, when old Nick comes wailing' in,
We'll see all we've been through (you know it's true)
Is a place I wanna go
Been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Now the villagers point out the place
Don't give us none of your aggravation
(Now you) wanna be up under me
Just know you're never by yourself
Bed-written and destined to never leave the
I've got these bones under me
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
Please keep me in this state
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Why does the sun go on shining?
I been gettin' money, boy, that ain't nothin'
If that gat wasn't all up in yo face
Well, we had our first baby, and I spent my last dime
We can throw the furniture around
I get tired and upset
Come and stay a while
'Cuz can't nobody do me better baby
Beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Na seulpeo boindamyeon nae nunmureun yeongi chumchuneun yeongicheoreom
You are my gleaming Goddess
And I don't miss you
Who deals in love beyond repair
But of the racist institutions, simple minds belong
'cause I done changed, I done changed that lock on my door"
I don't wanna let a minute get away
I'd say something went wrong in our lives
When the only thing you want is
Oh Ronald Weasley, you're the worst
Bright and musical, breathing purity,
I worshiped everything you did and said
They heard the stories nigga, now they wanna really see,
There is no answer inside your eyes
Standing in the rain, with his head hung low
Please don you self destruct tonight
G, are, A, V, E, D (Da Bomb!)
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When the odds are sayin' you'll never win
The lightening struck that old iron gate
Yea, your man got a gatt, but he ain't bustin no slug
I showed them a quick but a painful end
it has a great big slide for you to ride and swings that hang from stars
Then let us humbly begin
Living for the sake of living
The world is changing - just look away
now c'mon everybody, click your heels and do the dorothy.
I'm lookin' for sweet inspiration, every morning noon and night
niggas that you aiming for when emotions involved
Can't hear the tears cry
so now's the time to fight for our beliefs
All I know is what I feel inside
No soy Michael Jackson ni soy bicho rara
Frank zappa (guitar, piano, lead vocals)
I wish I could fucking learn to fucking walk
Looking back over my life I can see where I caused you strife
he never did anything about it.
Confused you isolate all your intensions,
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
Well I marked eighty points and I won me the round
ei jostain syystÃ¤ millÃ¤Ã¤n auennut
'Cause I know he's a lie
Pretty young lady, driving me crazy
With the morning storm brings another cloudy day
I bet they're taking mushrooms
Shiroi kumo wa itsumo kimagure jidai to kimi no you
It's too hard to mention
A day turns to a month,
And you wouldn't let it go
Got my mama's green eyes and my daddy's wild hair
Tears are in your eyes
one-hundred percent pure shit, uncut.
At least I never trusted what I was told or ever heard
With stick shifts and steering wheels, motorbikes and automobiles,
I lost too many friends I could count on
Little Baby pa-rum pum pum pum
Yeah Yeah sore de ii no kamo ne
Movin in the speed of Jet proportion
It goes on and on (goes on and on)
I guess there's nothing here for me
But I found it at last
Took a rich prissy bitch and played her this and made her gutta'
Y que me has hecho t
Brindemos juntos por el amor
But I believe I might have told you so
y el regateo de mi ficciÃ³n pura ficciÃ³n.
And that's enough for me
And you're better than me at football and my job
To get my sweet revenge
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
So what the hell did we sign
voglio prendere il viagra a 28 anni
And when you try you try too hard it comes off fake
Maar wat weet ik er nou van
Release ya sins, up, up in the slutty
We knew how to take a heed.
That I just can't afford
Do we really have to explain?
you told me you wouldnt ever let it out
Männer des Westens sind so, sind so, sind sooh...
And walk around wit my boxers on ya krib kid
But I don't know what it is
On the Cumberland riverboat, "E.W. Stephens"
The hoot of an owl the puppy dogs' growl
I play my cards but somehow I can't win
And I said 'My Lord God, you know that I do'
(Get the Patron and tell 'em that it's on)
Without a sound, snatch my Guinness off the ground
YanaÄÄ±na yanaq demÉ, yanaq demÉ
Yo, I be the Moses takin poses
When I seen an old pen layin' in the gutter so I reached down and picked it up
If you gave him consignment he said you'll have the money
What a dying world re-defines, the reasons we strive to exist
But being they ain't seeing me as human
You told me I was pretty
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
And you make John feel all right
While cruising on the black of night,
I might speak before I think,
'Cause you can say what is, or fight for it
Und aus den Boxen drÃ¶hnt 50Cent
And make mistake number three, yeah (ooh, mistake number three)
I see your picture in the news most every day
Strike you from the light
People, people, not colour, class or creed
I tell the dj slow it down, 'cause this bitch is all that
Whatever happened to the people
And I'll be flowing and going
That I could go anytime
I got that, I got that, I got that MILF
Und nur weil Deine Liebe nie vergeht
mama, take this badge over me
Tryna give it to you
Its only a dream, Romeo..
But how could I eyescan, I wasn't around
Yume wo miru koto mo
To lift us with him as he goes.
It Is In The In Betweens
Now I only wake up with a smile to see how far I've come
If music brought us here
In a city far away
Or wait to get on the plane
I love to hug her in the mornin'
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back
The funny thing is that I hear the same one
No regrets, no hard feelings, it's over. All the good times together are through.
Baby lets kiss the sky
you think i'm made up of straight lines, always contradict myself.
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy.
I'd see that love will conquer hate
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit,
You you you take my heart and shake it up
Thou silver moon with softer gleam!
I tell her that I love her but it ain't enough
Maybe I'm crazy but I
Tell me how it feels now
Another bottle of pills almoste gone;
I'm dead set on a getaway
Me barriste puesto en la esquina
But me, I expected it to happen
i have spent so much time
I want to let you know
But where ever you are, I'm still holding you right here, here in my heart
You know what the sun's all about
Just over the edge and I won't be scared.
And flip the whole set 'cause cash wreck for all my souljahs
Au fond de mes rÃªves
Collide like a head on
And I will not be afraid
I feel it, I hear it, I can see it
And I wonder is that you
If you don't see what I see
Don't you hunger boy, for she's no toy, or soon you'll pay
Machine gun mind and a junkie's rush
I'm floating in a black balloon
Boy you had me going all out for you
Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about
You're up here with angels
Isn't it cheap when I'm down on my knees?
Activate self-destruct, elimination is imminent
I'll try to be nice
Si querer es aprender, seguro que aprendere
Take my heart and never stop
I want you to want me this way
Where the sole survivors are flying.
Simply, it's pc within the verse
Now I'm back with my homies, and we ready for war
Black globes, old symbols of freedom
You race 'round in your fancy cars and you blow all your money
Come out the elevator - k-tone, like "Nigga what?"
I gotta let you know (not the one)
Aiyyo, who can test I, the true King of N.Y.
After I waited on you for so long
Let's tell each other what we want
daß ich nicht lache daß konnte ja nicht stimmen
There ain't no room for compromise, let your conscience be your guide
I know you say that you're over me
Mr. Jailer is your host
Forget the watch, I'll show you a good time!`
As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be was a gangster
Modern love does not exist
Yeah I think we both know, we cant stop
Nothing can strike me in such awe
Send a rose to your wife, she probably saved your life
Back that ass up, wine go down
Became the last time we spoke.
Long time, baby, long time ago, baby
Se felando nessa tara sem fim
From the BART train to a tour bus
And they're leading us, along
And who are you to judge her pain? 'cause now maybe your suffer the same.
Why I ain't your buddy
Room to make her big mistakes
Wow, know how to all night long
I hate to say it
I got a new girl
Or else I'd be assed up
I think you need a chair
Got a brand new house with my platinum mouth
Open your skull to a world that is dull
Keep it movin' while you kissin' on me
All the fettuccini say she saw a genie that's that loud
Colleen armed with charm and body
I thought I knew my way but somewhere I went wrong
There can be no sorrow,
And damn the dead and fear the mess
I want to show you it all, what to do and where and how
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove
So fucking cheap is everything
The beat that spins you around
go to the bar and drink some brew
Will he bring me some toys like the other girls and boys
And I believe you when you say it's hard to let go
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)
The clown came down to meet me
Qui rÃ©cite la vie du bout de ses lÃ¨vres, (ses lÃ¨vres)
That the first thing that come to my mind.
It hurts daddy to know and to know when
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Wait babe, won't you come over and play babe,
And his clothes were worn and old
Sometimes I wanna just fly with no stress at all
Sometimes it takes a lifetime to see the fool you are
Mirame amor, que estoy pensando en tener tu cuerpo, en tener tu calor
Att va osÃ¤ker och svag
Bitch your my slave, what should I make her do know?
I used to have a dog and Bingo was his name oh, so uh
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Ich scheiÃ auf alle und ich scheiÃ auf euer SÃ¤geblatt
There's a rope in the shed
Quin jugara a ser tu dueo?
Oh baby, makes me feel so fine
No we won't be shaken
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song
If you give it time
With who was supposed to be my life bringer
How could anybody say that dey the **** like I be
Tell me what you're feeling.
It's ripped, one thing for sure I'll be good
Look out and drop down low now
Tell me I'm not dancing all alone, no
As far as I'm concerned none of them niggas can fuck with the dreds
Birds are flying down the highway in the sky
And there you are asleep again
No, we'll never let you go
Shh!, listen and you can hear the ladies just whisperin'
Don't blow my hide just blow my guy
en las barras de los bares
She said love don't come easy
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.
Or another paying dues day
I don't know why I'm sittin' here
Is for the better now
If we never get the chance
sujuu ku tanssi, pelaan lpi pasianssin
Your heart belongs to me.
And now you just walk in the door
I watched you deal in a dying day
A ragged band they called the Diggers came to show the people's will
And though I'll be lonely living for only yesterday I'll get along
alla SantanchÃ¨! a Daniela SantanchÃ¨! (ah)
I don't want to dream about that future
Even got a lawyer, a cop in the DT
Tell him I love him; look him in the eye
this ain't my crowd no more, this ain't my crowd no more
Before you had a boyfriend, see you every weekend, had it going on, you were the bomb.
Phone calls is something that you're expecting
es scheint das gleiche licht,
Calm the storm, calm the storm
be fearless just like the Scorpios
Like a sound that to the depths of the soul
I demand a better future
Suis moi dans la chambre bÃ©bÃ© j'ai envie d'ken
No, just gotta be where you are
I know where yo' mama stay, I'll send a bullet straight through
Oh and kick the chair
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
So joe sinistr came through the armed recruit to blank crews
I got more ice than you got songs in your iPod
Don't care what you think
I won't feel the same
A ripple spreads to the shore's reach.
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Too much time on the battle line
Y floreci por fin el amor
A South African cherrie makin' history
You got to believe me
I can find somebody who's gonna love me
Fuck the fame, you can fuck the fame
You got your balls to the wall, man
Well, it musta been about eight or nine more minutes
I'll smile as you walk away
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
So I had to shoot him in the back of the head from 50 feet away
NOW THAT'S OVER, NOW THAT'S OVER
I am doll arms, big veins, dog bait
Nothing left to lose or gain,
If I had X-ray eyes, I could see inside
You make a Ninja wanna fuck, bitch, you make a Ninja wanna fuck
This is the story of the young heart
I wanna relax and be tender.
Really, I pick dude at the bar like really
(Ella ella, ay ay ay)
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall
once again have been put up for sale.
Everything lookin' good to the people of the world
(It's been so long darling) I just wonder if you really realize
Counter fits don't stop the wettest of us we Brooklyn
I swear , this love will find a real love
Do your thoughts begin to wander
Some fat kid told me we saved his life
Push the child into the wheel
If you were as real as me
I will remember your sins no more
Now somebody has burned the car
Get away from the world outside
Un casse-tÃªte pour monter dans le bus
And I break down, yeah I want to die,
She rocks me like the rock of ages
ganz in Ruhe und gepflegt,
We can change the world
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed
Sinners run and hide your face
Sleep all week with the same old witch
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
19 years old, worth more than her weight in gold
I don't want to believe it
All hit the deck with your hands behind the neck!"
They Sent A check, We Sent Em Work
And it keeps me turning home, yeah
I said, did someone let you down?
I buzzed your bell in, woman
Holly's in the window, home's where the wind blows
Oh my, thank you for keeping me safe
I survive for a livin'
You're dealing with the pro like (? )
that you are my everything (you are everything)
Baby ruff me up up up up up up up
Santa Clause through the backdoor
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.
The keepers of the ancient future
Don't go, don't go away
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Hope for my wish, the waves of a parting sea
She shotgun, and my milk Ghost so damn ripe, I'mma spoil with her
Well, the truth is that this girl was mad intelligent
My bitch look like Mulan, yo bitch look like RuPaul
So when another die, don't blame the devil, blame that other guy
Ah one two, ah one two
And I'ma leave the stage bloodier than a Tampon
Meanwhile leaves are still falling, you're too blind to see.
I can't help wondering where I stand
So nigga fuck around and get cut like a canteloupe
Not hey diddle diddle dumb dumb
There are the ones who sweep away your past
I am Calling Calling now, Spirits rise and falling
I been staring at you, shawty, all goddamn night!
Back before the ticking clcok
I wanna follow in the same old steps
There's nothing here that's left for you
I didn't become a musician
And I cannot pray anymore
Sign autographs, respect to accept it
It's better to be prepared and fail,
I don't think they'll ever listen so now's the time to act.
But I couldn't make you stop
And when she heard him say that,
Well, the lights are low I steal her kiss in the dark
We kill and we shoot each other in our own hoods
Such a waste what a shame my whole life is a fake
Because your the one for me
I didn't have it, wasn't able
And DAT's, messin up my whole format
Without him, I can't go on
How could i ever wanna lose your love
I had an uncle who once played for Red Star Belgrade
A sight no eyes are meant to know
Now, there's a certain thing
You will be my friend
Consider it all, before I get a little bit too deep to come back,
I don't care when they shoot the air
You used me and you lied
Was one of them relationships where nobody smiles
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
In the back of my mind
I'll find you any time.
I have to make a move to somewhere miles away
She got a big long car a lot of money too
Why the stall for no reason?
Street signs and swinging chairs
Maybe then you will live again, live again
Yeah, you knocked me down to the floor
You keep givin' me hope
A half a world away
No-oh, no-oh. I don't wanna take this place, no
and i'm giving you my heart to you to you
And I (I) know you're afraid (know you're afraid)
The floor manager is your best of friends
My bind will suck you... in
So super beautiful, they all wanna be, yeah yeah
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'llac
Then I've got the time
Lights are flashing and its crystal clear
She swear she got all the sense
They won't help you through
All over this world, local and Foreign
Time's running backwards from me and you
Tell me is it true? tell me it's ok?
Now they give a fuck about us
To confirm to me my deep belief
Most of the workers have no notions
But with pride in my eyes that put shame in you
And You Dont Holla At The Illest Nigga Underground?
to live a life with you
If no one in your crew walks around with a gun
I find fingers in my coat pocket
Crown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro-plaining pace car chase...
As one and I are both the same
Ãtre le Kalif Ã  la place du Kalif en Californie
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
But now I'm not afraid to say
Smelling like you on doche, nigga you well
At times I've seen you from the aureole
'Cause tonight it's goin' down
I seen the beast take life and say he had a knife
That nigga man, let me break it down real simple for ya'll
I ought to leave him, but he needs me.
The Chubbster, a man that came out about 1986
That didn't work out right
What the world needs now
I've broken the pact now.
Now there is no beauty in bleeding mascara.
Why you always all on my back?
Now it's over, it's all over
J'irai oÃ¹ tu iras qu'importe la place, qu'importe l'endroit
Now the good girl just can't be found
Running victim that falls in the scary cinema
Era vazio aquele rio de solido.
I'll never give up rep in New York, I'm true to it
(Living by the lovers' rules)
It won't be long, my darling
Well the best thing you could ever do is die.
Yo a usted la miro con gran devocin,
When folks I known for years, that couldn't pronounce my name
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me
Ha, ain't that some shh
People steppin' on my shoes
If you come to see me, hope you're coming soon
"This is a man's world!"
Do you niggaz wanna pitch in on a gallon of beer or hard gin
Then tell a soul, here's something on your plate
There's so much I gotta say, it bothers me everyday
Dont waste your time on me you're already the voice in side my head!
B-A-S-T-A-R-D, stick that needle deep in me
Don't you know you're my everything?
Got nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world to gain
She's got bette davis eyes
I walked my way around
Yeah, this somethin' special why'know, somethin' epic
I been away too long
Away from me with no explanation why
And you smile back at me, as I walk up to you
Now Im down here underneath
send me on my way with a question to ask myself
It's a shame you have to die
Don't try to explain, I admit it's over my head
Whoo, you can lay your pride aside
I messed up my little world
knowing you just took and took boy your so crule
Yeah, all the ladies in the house tonight
sehmi ankho se har rahoon pe tujko dhoond raha ab bhi dhoond raha
Cause I wanna back her up
Four little, five little, six little Indians
Amazing Grace is the song I sing
A faded star and an angel without wings,
She is such an integral part of me
On this cold winter's night
Yesterday I was your man, now you don't know my name
Considerin' that I'm belittling them, with little more then
You live forever but you never know that
und stell' dir ein paar Fragen.
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
She's just a girl, not a bad girl
Tu actuaciÃ³n siempre es el foco de atenciÃ³n
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
every moment that i spend with you there is no better got me feening for your body next to mine let this player lay you down one time you
But I'm caught in your after shock
Please read the letter that I wrote
So hold on to me
I'd like to see your face alone
I'm done fucking around with the guilt engine
Take your wings and fly, fly
from the Smith and Wessons.
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Get out all your lovin' here tonight
slipping, left your glock sittin' pon the coffee table,
and my forehead burned but I closed my eyes
It isn't in the Nursery it isn't in the town,
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
At the bottom of the situation
I know there is no need for what's been done
I didn't have the heart
Yonder come our kin-folk in the moonlight
And you're probably an OK person, if only you had a job
('Cause you filled it with fucking alcohol)
Holding on beneath the ring
Who walked through the White House without a buisness suit
I think I got too comfortable
And that's why I keep on tellin' ev'rybody, sayin'
We're goin' back, back to the start again.
'Cause even if I leave alone, I'm good
And I'm waiting for you,
Each time I think of the past how love was mine and went away so fast
They always smile and are polite
I wish I could be seeing you tonight
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
Somethin' happened along the way
Why do you pity youself like this
Cause baby's coming home tonight
I know that this is was I need to do
It's that time of the evening
You came out in front when I was hiding
You must be haunting me
I would try for you
Wrong way on a one-way track
Comma ti yippity yi yeah
Come on sloopy, come on sloopy
I've got to refuse her
I've got my big feets in the window
With keys of your own for when you wanna take it out to play
How fast can it go away?
Loc'in like Tone, street niggas get grown
Watch it how! The way we rollin' I'm sayin'
I'm dying in a damn beehive
Long as I keep toting I'm fine
you're the only one worth fighting for.
Seems that all I really was doing
Hark! The herald angels sing,
And when I wake up I'm alone
Got the snipers in the dually truck and we tooly'd up
Come on, come on, come on
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Me I'll never be lonely
Come fall into these arms
Call me Pharaoh cause I'm floatin' bustas up the river
On a barbed wire fence
Last June my cousin tied the knot,
And asked him: would you like to die?
Well I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wanna tear it out
And I would reach to you.
Daddy Yankee (Daddy Yankee Yo!)
a lot of people think I'm evil
And leave all the bitchin' to bitches
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'ma leave it up to you
See, you just get in the way
And if I go to her on bended knees
One of the many of the latin de este aÃ±o
cush is in the inside, pull me over
I got my niggas all across the muthafuckin land
'Cause I can't describe my love for you this way
Baby you want me, you need me
And stop pimpin in your mind knowin you a trick
I go, go , go, go,
Trying just to make you see
I'm gonna meet you there
Before I continue let me make one thing clear
Found dead on the road
Queda un gesto amable para no hacer la vida
And it's gonna be gone
My son, yeah well, he took care of me. He's took care of me
What's next got my mind on some group sex
I've trusted you before, babe and you always let me down
And do you still think of me when I'm gone?
whatever's good i got this grave half dug (true)
Ya need to stop fuckin' with them losers, now who's up
I think there's something fishy goin' on
Dejan el deseo nada ms
Through the smoke and the beer
Make music for the streets
My body's at home, but my heart's in the wind
All the memories that we've made
For so many days and some many ways we've been ducking strays
So don't let your stars go grey
You make me feel like an angel inside
God loves His children, brother, everyday
Which ignates the halo of our souls
Move `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!
Your goodness knows no bounds
If I loved you endlessly
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Lemme see if you can run it, run it.
Denn er erfrischt altes Wissen mit 'nem bisschen Grips.
The fun has just begun
& dance down the right lane of old 18
I said, "Who'll help me to forget?"
Who will know who shaped the stone
You are teh best paid mommy from the wrist
I'm begging you for mercy
All I've ever got is plenty of hard time
Nothing they can sing about
alles ging voll nach Planung, nie htt ich mich beklagt
When the past is finally dead and gone
Should he hit to the right
it's been weeks since i've seen you
So I'm movin removin wackness from my stratosphere
We caught Miss Molly rockin' in the house of blue light
And the vision that was planted in my brain
If I was the last person to know
Yeah, you gave me strength when I was weak,
I press start, here comes new challenger
Changing what I thought to be
Weil Typen wie du bloss grundlos große Reden schwingen
It's life I have to chase
Freedom, well it's a thing that is fleeting
Well, there's nothing we can do about it,said the neighbor
This ain't no gangsta song for you to sing along
But to say that I've lost you
Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand.
I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
Use me Holly come on and use me
No, she don't mess around
Whatever comes, whatever I face
If you keep swinging that knife
And it would take a strong, strong wind
And my heart goes out to everyone,
And the story I was told said, "He lived to be quite old
It's a Friday time to hit the hot spot
With the weight of the world at the end of the day
C'Ã¨ il padano il migliore amico dell'uomo.
With a nigga like Pac, and a nigga like me: gotta stay high
And if you give me time
Just so they can build another
Catch me if you can
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Ready to stand trial and move on
These days go on and on...
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go
This goes out to all y'all jealous niggaz and bitches
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
like candles in the street
and vanished as quick as he came
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
And the smile doesn't fade
Don't flaunt that the candy is good unless you came with plenty
Point it out like gimme that
'cause ya first born is strugglin' and it's hard to stay drug free
I'm going to go out and kid them
Too wet or too dry
And I cry out, is this life?
I don't recall or recognize
I really really really really really really like you
Take off your sister's new brassiere.
I won't be the one to hold you
You can see it, you can see it
(Fill it up to the top, I'm at my)
You say the right things baby, I like it
before they lock me up for all the bad things that i do
Shot down on the pavement
It's been tearing me apart
Lean wit it, rock wit it,
Can we keep the fame, the game, the name, and all fancy cars
Pick me up on your way down
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad enough they want me to choke
La sÃ© despertar, la se comprender
E mi sembra di non sentire
Same little nigga from the double nine
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
My wing span can and will employ full expansion
Putting machines in my brain
I just want you to know
So listen to me, so listen
I never could do that
Muscle - Im high adepta
So cold so sickly twisted beautiful
Might as well be the last one
Say that you don't care
He's the anyone who can help me
Another truth to find between the lights of our lives
This is what it sounds like
Some rappers just say it cause it rhymes
Daisy, it's 'Munk, I like this
Let's do the Ray Charles-ton
A big old smile on my face
There`s a bar at the end
To take away such sorrow
I woke up and screamed
And this fire is burning still
All you need are your kicks when you need 'em
We put the clocks back
But who keeps score when you're in mid-air?
I do it for you
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied
All around this small world
Â¡Tu mai es la gorda!
This is my openin, e comin at ya lazy style
In the name of love!
But now, now your gone
When the ladies come 'round
I'm too tired with my soul stripped bare
My car, my Hummer got 26 inch rims
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river
stop worrying about them other hoes
At the top we will be,
We've lost our good old mama
Well I moved here from the country, thought I'd try and get ahead
And when life had lost it's meaning
Keep ya where your worst nightmare snuck in
Cause girl being with you is enough
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see
(I can make your record stop)
[All] Another wild nigga from the Bronx!
And I just want to thank you
Dressed in black and we're singing along, to the
Grandmother saved paper to use next year
People think they're gonna freeze
And the way that you go on and on
So, don't get too discouraged in this life,
You give all new meaning to the same crap
I want to be the man who loves you
Trust and faith long since decayed
Follow what we once held dear
If you don't like what you see
All the money in the women's world will never make him change
Ho girato e ho rigirato
Some girls are always one up on us
So much love, and so much hate
I will never be free
Look at that, mama, don't she look fine
They say that I should leave him alone, let him be
Darling, let the monsters breathe
I can see what's coming, it's a bloody mess
The ones that's doin good and the ones that's doin evil
And said the next time, they would sail away just where they pleased
Or a second of thought
For grandpa and grandma and Santa Claus come Christmas day in the morning
Everything I do, I do it for you, oh yeah
A black-haired girl I called Abilene
Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
Are your smokes, your jokes
She's trying to figure out why the world is so cold
You don't know my name
We tried to get it right
And your body goes insane
Indossa l'elmo di Scipio perch ti legno e ti scippo
I'm bound for the ocean
I need a freak to get me served
The goddess of imaginary light
Like every lover hovers in my mind
She love my white T, my cars and that I'm icy
Seems to have misplaced his weaponry and armor
Oh, that's when you realize
Ended up tongue-tied and turned it into life
Believe I can give things to you, you never ever dreamed
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
The way she wearing that top got yo' boy so hot
She said "Fluffy? My cat's name is Fluffy! He was my best friend."
You and your sweet serenity
As the days go by, a little bit closer to you
We blow past em like in gone in 60 seconds
I've been spending many lonely nights here lately
Our hearts are Yours forever
Would you pray for me?
Trying to please in every way
She's got a classic custom mustang
This is an open door
In the beginning a hurricane
To know I wanna hold you and to know that I love you
An fixation a fix on anything the line of life the limb of a tree
I've been cryin' lonely nights
So viele klopfen an die TÃ¼r, weil sie mich suchen
To a place so far away from home
It carried me for miles
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
I go over so many fore heads
Had the eyes of a child of a whitness, something so wrong
An extra hour on the clock
The head of the table
Magic in his smile on his lips
T-t-turn up, V12 and I burn up
Couple hommies screaming East Side!!!
I'll leave with what I came with baby
Carries me out through the night
Between your heart and mine
If you could be anyone would you ever let me down
love solid for hours not even austin powers could top it,
(I've got them candy kisses on my mind)
I'm a [? ] you ten foot breakers
We are standing on the shore
This is it, all eyes on you
That he cut out my heart like a paper doll
My bitches, my bitches don't post none of his bail
No one shall live - only death is real
One Word, and the blind will see
They caught the last train for the coast
Everybody gon' do it when they step up in the club
conecrew levante e cante, passe adiante
when the brustle meets the rush
I'm the general that your boy saluted
Because it only hurts when I breathe
So you need to just keep
In the morning I got in a fight with myself, I got the bruises to prove it
The coming of the new Overlordian
There's a little boy at our house who's as happy as can be
I've been up to my neck on the railroad track
I thought I had you on a leash
Aim for places we've not been
I knew I'd be someone
"Can we still be friends?"
Smell that gumbo coming through that ole screen door
You realize it's never gonna be the way it was
Always quick fi start a war
Bitte geh, geh, geh mir aus den Augen -
Here comes my baby, back again
Black! Black! Black! She's black.
It's dark in the shadows when you're hanging out with giants
That's how master degrades you
Nobody like you anyway oh anyway,
My kind of town is anywhere else but this place
Want to want to go go around here
There is one way to show
You exist so I am cursed
And every day I play awake a nigga learnin' by haters
Are all that's left of loving you
Flood you can't hide, lil' boy
To realize you are a liar
And people never do what they want to.
Love you oh so well
I couldn't ask for more
(& where were you in our lean hour)
We feel the current go through
I'm a criminal with no crime
Come on and give it up
What has she got that I don't have?
And it feels like I'll never smile again
Nothin' but the net from the 3
I'm full of cherry soda and potato chips
But I'll be back to do another show now
To catch me and hang me
Para que lo sepas, tu lugar
Thinking oh that, baby, I was wrong
She can dance the walls of limerick too
The post returns for prodigal songs
Lemon crunch on her pinkberry
Nothing here you can pick apart
So let's all be someone else
And all my grave will warmer sweeter be
I spend that money on the regular
Yo no brego, pero mi pulsera
In beef we briefly bankrupt but you suck litigation
Gangsta Boo ain't scared of you, I'll walk up to yo' fucking do'
To be there for me
And the home look like the spot on the other side of the see's
denn er ist schner als ich.
Kinda magnificent, but always stayin' distant
Well you could be my love, you could be my love (you could be my love)
She's gone away, maybe she'd stay
See the dance that needs no alibi
I'll find my way home
E anche se l'assenza tua mi brucia un po'
Church bells in the hills they will ring and ring
I make my share of mistakes,
Comin' round the mountain when she comes
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue
Who he loves to leave alone
Closer, closer, closer to me.
Fuck an economy size, we want that big Royce
To start him a band of his own
Seeing them in my dark cupboard with my great big cake.
And now my life is far too gone (far too gone)
You've got to find a way,
On a cold November night
And the wind hits my sails
History is laughing at us
But daddy owns a business, so it won't be long
You have a video camera strapped
That kept me so close
If it's heads I might love again, if it's tails I'll cry
Homie they gon' lock me up, I'm still gon' make it to the top nigga
3x A million miles away
Hands, tooth, coats, and vitamins
Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
'cause I went to City High
Well, baby, baby, baby look at you
Did someone pull a rug away
Show what I mean to you
Not waiting or debating, cause MC's keep hating
I put my root down
Los recuerdos no me alcanzan
Now I need you all the time
Mendula destroyed by the sea
Ye ain't got your heart in the right place
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Even though its cold and dark yo i still wear white Nike Airs
I'd have to let you know
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
You cut me wide open like landscape
I wish that you were candy. wrap you with my body
We hang out by the bonfire
don't wait to be asked, no questionnaire will come
But if I didn't know, how did I last this long?
Who said you don't come around anymore
Fourth behind my body is my soul
Rap phat I'm that dude
Who dared to give it all away for me
Ich seh jetzt blöde aus
I might be here with you
And H.E.L.P. has got the best food in town
He's a big-city, hard-working man just trying to climb the ladder
Now if you take me up
Well the choirs were singing and the candles they were burning
We can go to the club or hide away
But, funny thing is we
My real name is Damien and my girl's name is Carrie
While my fingers round your neck as I commence to strangle
You a little sucker for love, right?
Snatch an acid insect changed her dialect
Let it burn, let it burn
We in Cancun, fly girly curly
But things are gonna heal again
Truly just check the suicide doors
Just when you feel nothing is real anymore
That I could never be the type for a loving wife and home
And when I've been away I've got someone to come home to
Y'all lips get loose like y'all feminine,
But you gotta play it like you just dont care
I knew right there you were the breath of life.
For all the lies you told
Ma, I been huggin' the block (huggin the block)
Where no one knows my name
All my second chances, they were not deserved
I just slap them, turn around and ask them this
Couldn't understand the value of things
Cross to the other side bitch you're gonna pay
You was the pimp of all panderers
The anchor in my storm
Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
My life was meant to give
(Tonight I want to love you)
Scary, if you mad say my name
Pain feel the void, when boy met girl
The miles that passed beneath us
Held me down for so long
I'm not sure it's been long enough
I'm no good to anyone after loving you
Wish I had done things different then she'd have stayed
No mater what my friends say
No triangle stop sign, I don't see any kind of stop sign in your way
We will rest in peace
Then lettin' it go by the boards
Well all right, well okay [x3]
He had no place else to go
Maybe this year will be better than the last
Black and blue, battered and bruised
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
Take a pinch of one man
He caused the blind to see
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine
There's too many Indians and not enough chiefs
It's getting better all the time
Cuando se duermen son indefensas
She's using all her higher knowledge
For the flesh that you gave just to get a taste
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
You haven't nearly paid your dues
Something for the ear so chill
Try to remember who you are, you'll never realize
I need Thy presence every passing hour.
dont get mad blame mah momma dem
Britches got too big, don't make have to walk a sinner
You're someone else's love, now you're not mine
I still believed in my dreams
Hey, i can't let you get away from me
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
Voltei pra casa e parece estar tudo tÃ£o longe
Come on, Come on, into my arms
I'm like the wind just blowin' on your hot propellers
The days were so much brighter
aber Ihr wirkt auf mich, wie ausgedacht.
Their own need for deception
And I can't fool around anymore
Then the night time came and I snuck out my basement door again
Right now we're flying over some land I own
Let me out of this place I'm outta place, I'm in in outter space,
But I could be your type
Is there nothing I can say
Take me in, into your darkest hour
You're the one & only who completes my story
I hear a voice saying not again
Nothing that I wouldn't try
Weights down so that you could move forwards
lento nos van tornando en sus siervos
Oh dear mother I've hurt you so
When we kiss, kiss the night away
Being so true, no rush (hey)
We met up at the Abyss ready to salughter the bitches
She holds it for me in reserve
And the muffled cries for help are the only sound
River stones and broken bones
As the girl who won't walk alone downtown
e che sia amore...andare insieme a noi senza bandiere e...
And in the fall, I do just that, I fall back
We're gonna party like its the end of the world
Time we needed to see these ideals for
Se despierta al rozarme con los pies
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
No I don't I've got no money in my right hand
My nights spent burying demons
AY... CAN I LOVE YA DA RITE WAY DA RITE WAY... O I WANNA LOVE U DA RITE WAY DA RITE WAY...
Every city every club mayn, we outlaws
No, she had never seen
You are red in a sea of black and white
Yea, yo, yo, yo, yea
Deluxe class top model. Toiled alone.
it never stops until it really hurts
Now there's a love song for you
And the orangemen remember, the old horse is yearly shod
If I don't change the pace
But from one friend to another
And you'll get to see through his eyes
Sell it now, selling out
And I just can't go on, if you won't see me,
And threw her arms around my neck
We're a couple of shootin' stars
Try me please don't, I'ma shot if he want
J'y entre quand les anges dorment,
As we rub against each other sweating under the covers
Send folk signals from the weed that we blow,
Remember my voice and sink in your soul
The smell of rotten earth
When the morning sun arrives then we'll decide if I should stay or go
Plus I got more than half a key
Are you ready, we're gonna do the Freddie
no s cunto tiempo perdiste
And this was a test that was bigger than him
My brother keeper, with the mother load
Blood sweatin, hollerin, your world wreckin'
When I come at you your bones just fall apart
Gather once again, disasters in the end,
You are the fire go on explode
God, wat sta ik hier te doen
You should have heard them roarin' when they dragged the bugger out
Who wants to be free
Or rise up children, life goes on and on
Or better yet, maybe, a pot roast?
Don't let em fool ya.
You ever seen a ghost? no
The Beatles met the Queen, and I wrote
The desert needs a beer
While so many innocent die
Ringo: Oh, I like grapes.
Bleed, it's that nigga that kill 'em
Don't you dare take off yet
I'm a be the one chasin'
Though I still don't know myself
When I wrote the words to the swan song
Nah I'll keep living this way 'til it's all done
'Cause I'm tired of playing and I'm tired of messin' around
I believe in,to let a little sunshine in my life
I want your high love and emotion
Royalty the shit put your hands up
All things considered I'm doin' better than I deserve.
Wanna push you baby, but never to far
There ain't gonna be anything
but it's never that obvious for me
That what you really really
I'm not sayin' I won't.
A veces hay que arriesgarse a la cachetada por no sino nunca pasa nada
And I want you to be mine again baby
A Barbie doll bitch or a hoe from across the border
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
So the years go on and on, but nothing's lost or won
Well, lucky number seven passed me by
Drives me crazy when you go away
A kiss from you makes me really strong
I need a chick to be kinda dope
I find that He is leading us out into the world
y cuando la luces te dan
All the love in the world won't take you away from me
If you can feel me open up let me slam now
Or question what it means
got behind close doors, it went down on site
You see its all for you I ain't the type to share
And the double game change, I keep em on display
And dump that crazy notion
You can copy but it's only goin' be one me
If you really want to make it right
Shes fighting for justice and the American way
Had a vision of the ruby sky we were riding high
So froze and Im so cold, slow it down Im so throw
'Cause I'm just tryin'-a do me
'Cause I'm thinking of you
And all that I have
Hearts will melt like ice
Fell straight in my arms
Lonely as an angel in a Godless sky
You can get, you can get it tonight
Party is goin' on over here (Say what?)
I know you'd see right through it.
To go get some bread and a pop and come back
It's a funny time of year
These girls that used to be buggy they turned to groupies now
Verdammt ihr schickt mich in das Land,
She's got the cosmic horn
Can't stop your heart from beating
So break this cup 'cause something might happen
He ain't nuthin' but a thug
I thinks its best you act right
Keep your head above and your heart in love
He don't need the power
We're not standing on the corner with a cup held out.
but love and hate cannot come & go oh so quick
Knew you had it comin' grabbed your plum and your gomez
Headed out for southern California
What can I say what could I do
I know, I know, I know, we can make it
It could be so lovely, it could be so lovely
And no one to say it to
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
We never do look sour
Very messy, yeah they're getting me down
She walks to me across the furrowed fields
Come running, come running through rivers with me,
We might just break it on the wild ride
The come home, walking that tough walk, talking that rockavalede
With their hairy backs and five-o-clock shadow and those are just the women
but I'm not going anywhere
And to the earth it gave great light
Betcha that she don't turn you on
Don't get me started, don't get me started
And did a real thing didn't we?
She be looking pretty, don't it?
"Land of song", cried the warrior bard
Here's to forgetting what you've done
Just can't hold it back no more
It's the way you love me
What is the truth of all that we know?
As long as it lasts.
You better tell me, baby
But there's way too much to do (OOO ooo ooo)
But you still don't get how things are...
Displacing logic in the memory banks of my mind
Ho bisogno di stare con te
You say you gotta burn to shine
Screw all my friends behind my back
Beneath the silver moon with my banjo right in tune
Now every morning just before breakfast
And they let you up, finally, dancing it up
I face your face & fade
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
And I'll be (the numbers on your watch).
It's got a way of showing you what you're all about
Now whose the chick to come ice the cake
Everyone of the reasons, we're failing each other
Duermo en nuestra cama y tÃº lejos de mÃ­
There's only so much we can do to make you rest assured
y el metro no acababa de llegar
And we don't have much time
I got into a beef now my friend is deceased
But the Reds and rain
Hear the rain drops tapping on the roof
If you don't get a bullet in your head
When you're down at the scene
Porque tu me haces vivir
And I smoked a lot of cigarettes
But I just kick jams
To a day of wrong moves
I'll be coming home next year
And then youre off on your way with my best friend
To get closer to you
Muchas nacionalidades, esto si es poder
Carry a, automatic weapon for my burial
If I was writting the book of my life
So hold me hold me in your arms
Or lookin' for a bridge when my cardboard gets soggy, so I could stay dry
I know I'm lost, I know I'm blind
Don't fuck around with my baby, man I swear she love me
Take the blinders off your eyes and fucking see the truth
On me suit, mon Ã©quipe ne change pas
Like a sea of flames
Oh I got nothing left to say from this day on
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
Tell me what you love
The day the world was ending
But I can't do it,
when you say you gonna sick around
If I could do it over
Se boit jusqu' la lie
And it's hard to turn a wrench on a rusty bolt
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
'Cause we got nobody else
Hoy te veo tan distante
And your out of fashion and shes out of class
Never fuck with these herbs
I know in this life, everything came from you
I'm gonna shoot ya down Jesse James
Let's hope we've always summer
'cause there ain't nothin wrong with a good shake at.
When you're doin' things in your way
Went away but I'm not forgetting
I said we take a little trip through time,
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
oh might as well be dead
we`ve been told all this before
C'mon you'll see how happy we could be
Mole, do you ever feel a little lonely?
What I Spit Is Legit Real Niggas Vouch For It
Daddy, Daddy, please save the world from the government
I know what I'm doing
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
But you know what's happenin', nigga
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
Though I've been playing prince tonight the castle isn't mine
Now am I loud enough? Do ya hear my name
powers are enlarged, their powers and their follies have become fantastic.
I was ready to take a chance,
Will continue a few days yet, a few days yet
He steppin' out with the older boys
Si aunque no quiera pienso en ti
Who will pick them up?
Changing the words of the story
No, not while I'm around.
Es wÃ¤r das SchÃ¶nste was die Welt jemals gesehen hat
So leave me believing we'll meet here again
I wanna be the one your kissin and huggin
'Cause I'm in the mood bit
An' your blood runs cold
'Cause it would do some good for my mental health
Before you take a second look, remember I know every trick in the book
(Ohh) He Sido Asi Desde Nio
Life can turn you in so many different directions
Que se te acaba el tiempo
Y sabes todo lo que digo va en serio
We done started from the bottom, made it to the top step
Of these want-to-be's, niggas they gonna see.
And then my cell phone will never stop ringing
With the songs that I sing
Keep it out of sight
Movin' to the rhythm of the mutha fuckin beat
Look at my cheeseburger ass
He knows there's something missing and he knows it's you and I
I hear the phone, it rings so violently
Girl when we meet, you're a
Bitch, I'ma be stunting until the day I go (what)
You make me cum, I might flood the block, wet on my socks
I don't need a girl, don't need a friend
For example, to demonstrate his ability by running through all the Charlie Parker licks
3-4 leaves you dead on the floor
Just the way it was Joe, just the way it was Joe, just the way it was Joe
Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
I got girls that'll buy my a quarter
There's so much today, who's got time to listen?
My boys spread out, got their girls, and rappin
Something about the way you look tonight
Remains yet to be seen
And in the blessed name of Elvis well I just let it blast
tryed to play me cause I have'nt seen him in a while,
And everybody wanna live another life
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
I don't compete with other ballers
But she left me sorrow and fear of tomorrow
Down a winding road with the retards screaming
(homeboy) I'll always be the one that ill!
Cause sweetie you're my kinda guy
Nahante jal geollyeosseo neo mariya
My room is still messed up and I know why
You loved me but now we're all dead
Cause this world is a whirlwind, but I'm holding that trapeze
I'm still staring at the sky
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me
Could be drought, could be flood
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Girl, Why you wanna get funky wit me?
They know that Santa's on his way,
Oh, the fishes will laugh
Playin' anythin' I wanted to play
That is running out on you
Que escasea en estos dÃ­as
C'est tellement extraordinaire d'etre ici ce soir
Never been the social type, well I never drink champagne,
Try and take control of it
Ma sono lacrime mentre piove piove
Time goes by, (time goes by)
I'm at the point in my life
We try to bumble like ass
Wanted me to be the only one
On summer nights like a sauna
After the party it's at my spot
It ended when you said goodbye
i'm up in the swisha house
There's not a whole lot of difference
A half a mile below
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
That's brought up in a home of sin
Why can't you see it, girl
Yeah, it's a beautiful world
Vieze Freddy alsof je dat niet wist
But I have given you all I had
Saying, "Throw me somethin', Mister, please"
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Check the Bible for a honest diagnosis
'cause I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
My sense of humor might have narrowed with my age
And have you sport it as hardware
They don't wanna see me shine.
While our hearts were young
I lost my faith in love
On and on and on you wait
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
You tried to duck your head
I'm given sixty seconds to catch my breath again
never been the one to hurt me
Tu sei nella mia storia e lÃ¬ ci starai
They crawl from the oceans to paint in the caves
Living every moment like it was your last
Uhh Killa Let's Get It On
Fui longe demais, no fiz por amor
All I got is you baby on my brain
Power-packed in black, to make you see mad graphics
And you'll find a woman in love
Go ahead and show this world
You said you'd love me through thick and thin
There's no strategy to remedy
i'll eat ya ass alive like my name is Jeffrey Dahmer
But as immovable as a mountain, and it is dark all around.
Baby you'll be out of your mind,
and he taught me the way to win your heart
Don't forget whose child you are
Oh, oh, oh, building a fire
It's about our pet dog Barfy
It's the Busta bust with the new format
When I'm all alone in cold December
Did she really get that strong
Since I- since I felt this way
I only want a proper house
I don't even know your name
Girl you got to let him know
As long as I can be with you,
that's like my uncle getting approved for credit
and everybody had food that day
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
I'm that Goodfella fly guy, sometimes wiseguys
And levitate heavyweight niggaz like they was featherweight
Now when she wants it she can't be denied
Should I reach for the sky
to show him that my pitch is better
Find me out on a mountain top
Are you gonna run to me? Oh
I lived alone but I was only
Loving you could be so great.
I wanna get so high
'Till the heavens stop the rain
And it's the love from my fans got me still here
Dammit we P-driddy? Now I got G with me
Lets stick that motha fucka when you come back
"Fr-Fre-Fre, Freddie Foxxx with the twin millis" -> O.C.
I'll be good yes I would, especially for the one
chop up ur remainder body parts off ta feed ur children
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you
If you try you die, visions blurred, speech slurred
And I like this feelin', light it up and smoke one, feel me
But for the guy who can`t be seen
I shouted I'm the king of the world
Cause it felt Real At The Time
Nah, this ain't make belief, I'ma make you believe
Got me high and I ain't comin down yo
a great set of nothing
I might have went too far
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Yo Hobb we got more rep than Lucky Luciano
I shook the buddy system wisdom till the similairs repel
Get ready get set (get set get set)
Till the day when we're old and grey
Young nigga move that dope
and you go where you know you should go
We all headed for the bar
God, it hurt me so
I'm still waiting for your last kiss
I'm running to her like a river's song
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing is change
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
You are the only thing in this world
And if you escape, you better swim fast
In another ten years time
I'm breaking out my six-string and playing from my heart
Another day for you to realize me
And you came to watch us play
F, fuck 'em for change nigga
I dont know which way should I choose?
And she swore that she never will see me again
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try
Get out my way, you industry, we in the street
Like Bugsy Seagal and do it all illegal
Baby I'm still in love,
It takes a little bit a smackin'
Love to blind me like the sun
Its your big shot baby your the next big star
Please tell me who you are
So Like A Dyke With Hollow Tits I'll Rip The Mike With Hollow Tips
And I know once the clouds shed their tears
So why you gotta act a fool tonight
I can't k-k-keep it down, no, no I can't!
With statue of liberty doll.
Call up all my niggaz in New York on the celly
With techniques of positive mutation
so i took that green stuff and i chugged ten of em
When things weren't like they are
Time to face off, B-B-Break you off
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Now [unverified] I was just listenin' to this song
But that's the way that it goes
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes
Sapling switches will rend those rags alright
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
And he'll kiss your lips
Shit you barley showed me
Don't make me live in asylum
non li chiamano angeli e non li chiamano santi
Yeah, give me the power It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
Que sabe bien que al final saldr con vida,
Blast till my thumbs hurt, yeah nigga shooting first
Is worth any sum or length of time
I'll get you back someday
Willy Denzey, Willy Willy Denzey
It's hard enough to gain
The enemy shrivel and die
And that makes one of us who can't give up
But baby that ain't a crime (oh yeah)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
Crumbling about our ears, Ole
Is there anyone at home?
Let me tell you now
all the songs all the words
Watching all your armies begin to run
I guess that I was blind, now baby I,
Bring me my arrows of desire!
With a whole quarter key
I'm looking for that girl with angel wings
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
Better watch boy, where you be at cause I'm a hit at, three flat
Now you're four whole hours behind
Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants
Oh baby let me breath
Said the hearts all over the world tonight
Through all my thrown-out stuff
Rule the black bishop over the world like a guided missile
To join the Magnificent Seven
Peep this streetness, never had a weakness
It started in the morning, it happened so fast.
But makin' sure that they spending ya
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you
I want a moment without an end. [x4]
And call your name, will you remember mine?
Que bueno que no te mande un carajo
Sent from somewhere volcanoes are
Can you rescue me from the rain
Crashing through the cigar smoke
Man we've got it bad
Don't skip all the courses
Weeks turn into years. How quick they pass
Ya'll still crusin lands, I'm navagatin dog
I'm a substitute teacher, welcome to Sex Ed
Margo walks in another place, well
I'll always regret I let you go
Blowin D's all the way down to New Orleans
And the question isn't if
If you want my love, well that's how it's gotta be woah
Suddenly easy to contemplate why, why
Feeling like a freight train, trying to break chains
I need to feel your body just a pushin up, now baby (baby)(I'm goin get you opened up)
I wish I could turn it around
Or his short little piggy fingers
Put our posters on your wall
We have now a special request
omoidasu yori mo wasurerarenai hibi to ieta kara
And a partridge in a pear tree!
Before you drive me insane
Niggaz don't want beef with me
Getting things done around here
Wir werden erwachen unter falschen Propheten
She'll be a helluva time but nickel
Dancing alone, lost to the beat
He wasn't scared of nothin' boys
How hard it will be to come back
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
But I Ain't Got Nothin' That You Can Use
Chasing the sun back to the West Coast
Wander like I just don't care
The images in my head
Fu*k everything else but getting paid
Detonator set, ticking bomb on deck like
he stood on the edge
To do all the things,
What if I don't have to say goodbye?
So pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever! (Forever)
Five long years, every Friday I come straight back home with all my pay.
Doch ihr hewrzblut schreit nach einem Bodybuilder
And every time you hold me
y sigo sin hacer nada.
Ill make amends with my exes
And I don't wanna hurt you but I'm moving on
REAL HUSTLA' NO SELL NO COCAINE
And you whispered My True Name
Like diggin' down deep in the record bins
Don't despise it and don't adore it
I was wrong from the start
hay que consumir como cien tabletas,
John wrecked that Austin won't soften you're lost and
Digo que te deseo pero te temo
und dieser Freund war ein Mann,
But let your love flow back to me
I fell asleep in the living room
Just to stay between the shores and
Oh my darling I love you so
I'm the one, the one that'll make it clear
It's calling me back to my home
Cause you're still my boo
What means the world to you diamond rings shinin things
Since nigga's did the snake runnin' man in the walk
Por el suelo camina mi pueblo
The plaice play the bass
Bite his leg!... then I got away
I'm gonna roam this mean old highway
She couldn't make another day
I left everything for the ingrate Silvie,
I have to stay out of sight.
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
I need a new snack
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Very much in love with you
Te quiero tanto que muero
Fucking ought to stay the hell away from things you know nothing about
Ro sey Was Pouring Like Fountains I'm Drowning With Twenty Sixsis
Cheoeumigetji So Sweet neon ireon mat mat
'Cause I will need you for sure
Or move like a swallow?
But I need to tell you something
Who do you think you are?
(get low bus!) it's crowded mami move it along (uh huh)
You don't have to leave me to see what I mean
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
Walk along with me, come on, don't tease me
You heard "All Eyez on Me," niggas know what time it is
Back to what I was talkin' 'bout
I'm bout gangster shit, and hoes know I'm working with something
And they called you the next-of-kin
Might valet park a Brinks truck
I will run, I will fall, I will run to you.
Take you higher, margin later, right now not later
Another battle to be fought
Sex-money-murder we call this the hit em' up flow
I'll give you my love
Your book, just a thought to you
What it'd be like, to be me
And where does that leave me?
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
I was giving you the best
Things were good for a, couple of minutes
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
But I'm not afraid when I'm with you, you, you, no
Now I don't see you no more, no, I don't see you no more
I'm tranna clean up my mess and explain
Still impossible to see across
When I know it's time for me to go
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos
Senza farci del male, senza piangere mai
Not that I realize. just a simple fuck around.
I step aside into the shade
Fuck flowin', I'm turning niggaz into Jesse Owens
Pero aquel amor vivirÃ¡ siempre
That will not die will not die
They ask me Arhys, could things be any tougher?
Of maybe telling you this could be love
Die Dame in der Schattenwelt
Turn this house into a home
Yo quiero recorrerte muy despacio.
Depends on what's wrong and what is right
You won't ever see through me
And you can move like I've never seen
Top down, put the sun on bitches
Wantin to squab with your homie over a bitch
And in your own dead indifferent way
Niggas everywhere and other niggas just stare
(All I need is just a mic and a track)
Igniting the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
'Til I hit the main line in that cell confined
But the style that I'm using is just like karate
It could all go back
Live an illusion, don't let it fade and die
I just wanna be close to you
If I could be there
About the rule at the top
I'm gonna man up and tough it out
You're drinking up a cure now
I wanna feel the sun until I'm blind
Really wanna go to the island, my feet up on a tree,
Dont answer me, dont break the silence
I hope I never see You in another life
I choose to be me.
I guess they know way down deep in their bones
Then suddenly it was gone just over night
And it's too good to slip by
Quisiera saber que hice mal
as it starts to take a shape
The core of our spirit is naked
Ain't it odd that yo fucking jaw ain't broken right now?
And seen er in my dreams
don't you ever go this way
If it was anybody else but you
Bv's we came, we saw we won
I love 'em all the same
I know that I'll soon go mad
I'm scuba divin' in Jamaica trick
It just isn't right, oh, why should I be cold?
Idioten werden Hukke-Busch ernten und ernten dafÃ¼r Applaus.
Got to row, got to roll, got to row
Apart in pink and perfect moments play
"Au Cul !" me dit l'Ã©vÃªque !
I chew my nails and i twiddle my thumbs
I'm walking, I'm pacing, my heart is racing
There's only one thing on my mind
This time my happiness won't disappear
I tricked my my mind its true
Look at me, I got your money
I remember when my mama told me
Two for the motherfuckin' haters keep my name in the game
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done,
And that's all there ever was to it.
I couldn't stand to stay without you
Mashin through the city yo, and the foot it don't lie
I know what you really feel.
I feel your arms when I'm lonely
Y con los aÃ±os que me quedan por vivir
And there's puppets and dollar bills
My definition is high, I thinks its blue ray
As we set out on this journey
I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
Who you are, who you are
Lie on the bank and stare up into the blue
Ready or not, this is how the end gets told
Oh, what have you got to do to believe?
Right now! I'll take you gladly!
Love and lies she gave to me
Joy and sorrow never last
Like you're floating down a river scared there's a waterfall
Just as I start closing in
You know the one thing
It's hard to pin me down that way
Well, the engine is just warming up.
You've such a vivid imagination
'cause you wanna hear about shit like this
you mad, cause i got my own shoe
I drove my car in the middle of the night
I've been left with nothin'
one time is all it takes
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark
And you mutha fuckas still tryin' to calm me down,
When they ask you what you're thinking of
We'll just let love lead the way
I lost my heart to a meat hook
Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer
I'm talkin' 'bout the ever changing winds of fame
Of swindlers who act like kings
It's with two pennies and a match
But the funny thing is anytime I've gotten what I want
My nose was too close to see
Press his peoples, left a message, nothin' peaceful
gaa denkt alleen mor aan aa aage plezier
They ain't tryin to go to Heaven
I come with new shit and have em like what's that
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
And another handful of cats
It's only when I lose myself in someone else
So I can show someone how much I've grown
Nothing left but picture frames
Teach me how to, teach me how to, teach me how to jerk
We've done our share of slamming doors and wondering what we're together for
Can you see.. the pride of the panther
Oh, I'd love to be a teenage idol
Your cruel jokes and violent behavior
It ain't a secret, bet that I slide 'em with something I could freak with
BECAUSE I FLY LIKE A BAT OUTTA' HELL
Thinkin' crooked, just to come up
Come home, come home quick
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick (nah, it's true!)
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
Still regret nothing 'cause we
I wonder what it's like
Blame it on the beat of the drum
I'd never thought that I'd ever say
There's a pattern to our time apart
O holy night! The stars are brightly shining
Roule moi une pelle, saute moi au cou
And fuck the po'-po', nigga keep a fo'-fo'
If not my boy will put the beats on you, Karen Civil ya
I think I'd lie for you
Tried to show I cared
My presence is an event, the party don't start until they let us in
I don't want bad luck and trouble
It seemed to be last night
O tidings of comfort and joy
When I can see myself again
Que le fond des bouteilles
How I'm gonna love you
To walk from the darkness
Like the eagles that fly above reaching the light
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid
let me love you to death
He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,
All I do these days
they say that im they favorite
This love hasn't changed me
Let the music heal your soul
I will wait for you
Was forget about her problems
And we got to work it out alone.
I don't wanna know 'bout evil
movin bricks like I'm try'na build a pyramid
But I'll try to resist sinful ways
'Cause I've got nothing real, just empty space to fill
And it's going and it's going and it's going and it's
To say how funny you are
Hit up the start line
I know you're still there watching over me
And in the distance is the sound of your guitar
Oh, its so better now
Olly Olly Olly Olly higher than the king can
So now my soul's in debt, I must regret
Consegna in tutte le case
But we wont come inside when Grace calls our name
When you see me, please don't talk
Who you been lovin' since I been gone
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Hablemos el mismo idioma dame la mano, mi hermano)
Tonight we're gonna tear this place down
We do the dolphins' dance duet
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here
I guess it got too hot and you just couldnt handle the fire
Then the answer is getting revealed by inches, you are finding yourself.
When you knew they were all that I had left, nothing left
New plates on it, hold them keys up
This siphon drinks the water
See it, yeah, I can see it
The kind that every girl dreams of
And I have no answer
But she lives on her own
Who you are to Me
Somebody save me, I think I just killed somebody baby
yall aint ready yall aint ready come on now yall aint ready yall aint
The lines of life are never long when seen from end to end
I'm seeing my growth, but I'm still from myself
we dont need to get it right
(How you want it?) How do you want it?
and mom dukes discuss the where abouts of young man
I'll take your rhymes and separate them like a prism
All across the alien nation
But I couldnt come in
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me. (They be snapping, baby!)
They didn't mention how much shit was gonna change around here
We hear Your voice cut through the darkness
i dont think these niggas can bear it
You high high you will know why - you're
So I won't be fooled by his angel light
The sky is ours to keep tonight
Roll around like a copo, eatin' on chicken
You can tie me up, you better let me go
They point their crooked little fingers ar everybody else
You told me I'm different
I'm guaranteed to get whipped
No one knows where i have been,
It's hard to take when love grows old.
Thoroughbred, thorough head makes you moist
Growing up like the women from the exorcist
It's kinda hard through carelessness I scared they moms
We could clear this town
And kiss "goodbye" to the earth
Of days that used to be
In the grey December morning
Said "Strip down 'til you're naked
Lithium, I wanna stay in love with my sorrow
Better stay on a nigga brain give a fuck about a die-hard!
Now you got to face the facts, face the music
Why do we bother to stay?
What do you get when you fall in love?
Cats want to leave me for dead you comin with me
yeah i've fallen for you and that's no mistake
To buy drinks and dance with every little girl that look lonely
We bow down and worship Him now
Maybe just a little less
I'm singing you in every breath I'm left to heave
Nah nah nah ha - oh oh
To never even give a little piece of me.
Baby it's the last time.
You did, baby - you did
Must not be mistaken for just another dream
I kissed ya, oh yeah
se instalaron en mi cama.
It's so hard, to be let down (Let down baby)
I'll bring the end to your claw
So after all what's this life living for,
Little lies and massive dreams
para que le muerda mi cancin.
Spent the day out on the lake
It's me now that they want
I'm still glad that He did
street fam for life, this we all owe the los
All I know is what my heart's sayin
I wanna break bread wit' the cats that I starve with
so what you know my first name is like Mark
Bet she doesn't touch like me
Murray a get him groove on roll in the streets sey him a fi come a Weddy Weddy fi see it
Say what you do for me than, I'm good
Po-po came quick then heat up,
Can you feel the pressure break
Me voy de aquÃ­ con,
Could you rest your weary head?
Blinded by love and misery
My women are ornamented with a blood soaked wreath
All the hoes look like they want to hump
Do I think I'm understood this thing
When they hear that drunken voice
im up in the attick
And now he's gone and it serves me right
Look at you, you sorry ass, low-down raggedy bitch
But times have changed and so have we
You can't deal with the man
So that's where I've been drinking
I know now that nothing is free
Well, I woke up a morning
Someday I'll stop my traveling
And I swore that I wont ever hustle no more
And had a couple dudes to support him actin all like
I fell in love with the Rollie
Give me the strength to say goodbye
Dear president and plastic wife
Times like this that you want to plot a coup
My friend dread is right on time, can't start to think that it is fine
Me esta esperando que me entienda y si no me entiende
It's a shame we can't always win
Just give a brother some of that kitty!
Out of my window, I see a picture
I mean I'm just being condescending
I can't concentrate on the road
Be all that you can be
She just feels like dying
Well, I got me a couple tickets, take my baby to the game
Oh, I didn't mean to yell
As we are only passing through
I'm left with the promises you didn't keep
Teddy don't worry now your mommy is here
You see I'm not [Incomprehensible] take you there
Oh, my future, my future
A change in me every day.
I wish you weren't in it
No on needs to be alone, oh save me
More than a childrens game to play
O Pop nÃ£o poupa ninguÃ©m
And I have to fetch the eggs myself
I hope you find it with me or without me.
Puisque le monde est sourd
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
And I know, I know you're waiting
Was the moment I came alive
Can I lay in your bed all day
Then you really might know what it's like
I will be next to you
But I'm there when you're not over his friend
You wake up late for school, man you don't want to go
Mix up passion with fruit, sangria
Ran into a rainstorm, I ducked back into a bar door
Together we'll break these chains of love
Got lost along the way
He chose us, chose to love us
There's just excuses when the truth is nowhere near
If you weren't so far away
Where it's still fuck the police, white and black cop
I'm movin' faster than a Jimmy-8
revenge is best served cold and sweet
There wasn't anyone out there I thought I needed to know
And my days are ending
I try to be nice and help the poor make money
Hate lost inside, I dare to dream, faithless lies
Go out looking for some strange new games
Only a fool gives this away
You're such a low-life schemer.
Love further down, adore that denial
Brought together by a movement and a sense of tradition the strong will survive.
I don't believe in your philosophy
I've been away from my lover so long
Hey, hey, hey die Fantas sind in der Stadt
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade
Ah, Sara, wake me up when you're home...
Todo lo que quiero se me va
Got females that do lick, and some that strictly do dick
Let's make this easy and let time pass, as devotion dies
Make it loud and hard and fast
Oh and when I see you
No need for desperate alibies
When you hear the song,
I'll never let it go
Hell has no device against the hearts that feel no fear
I wind upon ya hip hip hip
Well today what I want to whisper is hope
'Cause I really want to run into you, again
Jimmy, my heart is full of love, only true love
we're all just figures messed up in coincidence
But I can't begin to even imagine,
It's just the past and now it's gone
Turn it on, turn it up
Everything is gone so young, you don't need me around
Prescription pills, your favorite tossup in a pill
Life seems dead and quite unreal
'Cause it's all part of my plan./
Some day you'll realize I was the one
Je sais que tu pardonneras tous mes faux pas
Walking home from school one day
I need metal through and through!
Everytime Im Fixin To Chill A Hater Pop Up Im Feelin ill
You better check your priorities If I'm gonna be your girl
How bout a fast brunch
Say some shit that you might not like so
You're better than any midnight sex
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Melodies were kind of rough but you knew they came from the heart
Well, is it true baby? Oh yeah, baby.
Flowin' behind the preacher's fiery eyes
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
All his friends thought he was funny
Bitch with me big titties and a small waist
And I'll never be her
I sing because I'm free,
Quiero recordarte que bonito que es verlo
But in your dreams you can buy expensive cars
Where they were whiskey drunk
I decided I'd drop in there that night
And I'm a grown woman
"You're comin home soon" sounds so nice to me
Heey, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray
I'm sittin' here, la, la
I promise you, I promise you
Drive to dream to live we could see the world tonight
No! Get out my face please, can't you see I'm on the net
You should know by now
In time, but time takes time you know
And when I'm in some stranger's arms
Mama we're now so hungry now
Gripped by despair so cruel
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
I fall to my knees and I pray
All the colors have faded
And my brother's back at home
Just want to play on the rhythm guitar"
One dumb dog to my residents
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
the warmth of a cold floor
Of this new sickness that I
Somebody taking away another part of me
Are we allowed to make brand new beginnings?
Sometimes I need you, honestly
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOW
Clear blue 'em, day after pill den lose 'em, I got one
'Cause I'm only here to share with you my world
But she ain't goin' for no mystery
Just see what the hell we find
Lost when the wind blows
And paid for my own bribery
Or ? ? ? your mr. cash for the capital
Another face in the crowd
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
All balls don't bounce....volume 10 know
Yo solo quiero pegar en la radio
And all the cool kids in the back of the bus
And he said he wouldnt change for no one
Me nah go put no triple six inna mi head you must be mad
Illustrate the difference between you and me
Gates of heaven are open wide
Who would roll with y'all
I know it just can't be, darling, no no.
I'm gonna pull it, pull it, pull the trigger
F-ck the gun as long as its infrared-red
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
Oh baby tie me up
He's waiting for the panic to set in
Free to pound the lost streets
I'll never forget it -
Instead of playin it cool we gotta get the gat
I know she couldn't be psychologically scarred
Just stands alone, her face set in stone
And Sara brought her new stilettos
And we can act like we did before
A rusted silhoutette embracing burning filament
A vision of how we could have been now
We talk about sounds, we talk about movies
I'll show you how to walk the dog
right in back of the caddy
Got 2chainz bitch I'm icey as fuck
Show me love, show me love
Ain't nobody's business if I do
'cause you'll keep goin' crazy 'til your mind is gone
I'm goin' home then maybe back there with my friends
Maybe girl he deat meat
Everyone said I hurt you,
Teukbyeolhan neoui geu modu~ Woah Oh Oh
All I want is you (Now baby don't be shy, you better cross the line)
Put the city on let's get it
Streets kept me laced like bloods dipped in hennesse,
I said the other side of crazy
Matched to the West side, still got the 2-2
cuz real girls get the boys!
Homeward, back to your land,
When you live inside a circle of salt, you're near the end of your days
That kept you on your own
I ain't got no love
Special Branch got their feelers out,
Take it off, stretch it out, gon' head let it out
Gently knocking at our door
Lay down softly in our sorrow
On you, on you, on you
I wonder who will stop the rain
You only have to dive into me
It's that new 'Pac y'all
I blame the world for making me such a freak
Che non gli importa di mostrarsi alla gente
Would you like to be my new best friend?
She said maybe you're ashamed that things turned out this way
Once again a testament of pain
Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
We've knocked our bones together for so long
No prob, we'll fix it in the mix
Crawling alone through the soot and stone,
Clinton Sparks Ft. Mike Posner - IDKurName
You know, taken out of context I must seem so strange
I wish you nothin' but the best in sickness and health
Man I was beat, I was driven by the heat
Come on, let me be the one
Marc Jacob shades, 50 karats, all ice
A beatless heart lying still, murdered by illusions of the mind.
Now they all on my side, I call it alucard
Lifting me, don't know how
Is it real or is this just a fake
A thousand people gather in the streets of Manhattan
My mother did the best she could
That is worth all the money in this world
For trying to sleep on the beach all night
It's the right time to let it roll
Wait until we tell the girls we're moving down to the Gulf of Mexico...
Best shape of my life, I'm sick if it thug
Nobody can deny that there's something there
I can't get after someone else, none of these weak bitches
It ain't safe., in the current state, of our democracy
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
Black Madonna, hoes kill for they popals
Y quedarme aquÃ­, sÃ³lo tienes que decir que sÃ­
Ooh, but Lester Shy and the Shyphonics
Don't say a single word unless you speak with a drowning tongue.
That's the wrong thing to do
God, how i wish that this dream would go on
Maybe because at least we know we made it
You are all my life
So love where you're at, yeah love where you're at
I get him hot and bothered
I ain't pretty so my fetish ain't knighthood
You know there's only one shot
I'm never gonna let you go
Y construyamos todo otra vez
I wait for you, my queen
to another after gun with a rubber
And if you don't know it now
Ya laugh 'till ya don't think it's funny
Then it's gone, gone, gone
And it was you telling me
I ain't got no competition so my price is up
Me, myself, and I my three friends
Near misses on the dogleap stairways
So just for a little bit, baby
'Cause I try to make this shit work
Because you were out of sight.
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
And while we blow the spot and keep it hot
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had
Hey I'm on my way
Odd accounts of where I've been
I'll ride around throw my set-up I ain't never finna let up
Spend a little time with you
Into, into, into the future,
We'll be here a while
Every time I hear that song
What use is a paper heart, when you're stuck in the rain, stuck in the rain
I'mma get 'em get 'em so come hit the repeat
I don't wanna let you go
We used to hold hands and had such a deep convo
And baby I'll do you up, do you up baby
With love, from me to you
So I walk in the sun in my rain hat and overcoat
In every town now, all around
My potential here with you
I don't know who they are
And I close one eye now
You won't give me what I can't bear
The 747 has just arrived, way down in no man's land
THESE ARE THE DARKEST OF MY DAYS
As he gunned the motor
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna love, love, love
When you and I ahead of time, learn each other, we can have supper at noon
When he came and sat down next to me
And when I'd go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I love you
I may not sing your favorite songs but I don't sing for you
Break-A-Bitch College got a scholarship just for you
Shawty when I do my thang, I ain't gon stop
Can you hear me can you hear me
Hello, it's me - the girl you had to have
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
And girl, I just don't know
It's our big chance and I'm calling you now
Then you should've put a ring on it
Bright lights on the houses down the street
I Can Rock Your Body
More Caddy-shack than Breakfast At Tiffany's
And while you're out there in search of you
Stop! In the name of love
Things like a lovers vow
Where has the time all gone to?
Los Que estan arriba, te roban tu dinero
Ooohh..let the music free up your mind
Cornrowed by a L.A. bitch
But if you go to the Bahamas you'll see them all there
I cannot tell a like
Till we see morning light
I see your pussy lip lookin fat through them tight ass clothes
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
All these people drinking lover's spit
(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
And I know you won't treat me right till I do
Ooh ooh the city's new the faces change
It's gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin' summer
Um dich nur ein einziges Mal zu lieben ...
Come and get me fired up (Fired up)
They kept on wailin' windin' up the song
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
She takes away my pain and sorrow
And you can lick but don't bite
You and I will fly away to
He fumbled for my hand
I love her, she love me
Change whatever gets strange in your aprons and your curls
The train stopped in a field of oil wells
I used to go out to parties and stand around
Bitches gang, gang and you know that's to the end
Because the music they constantly play
And if they say that you're wrong
We can all be scared to death
While her heart is all alone
Man you fuckin' with the boss
'Cause I'm so over it, finally having fun
ooh i think im faaaalling doooown
Come on, come on, come on
to change slow your ways still
Stay and take my fate
You walked away in silence
You know what you gotta do
Now I see why they say it's safer to fly
Wissen wir du warst da, wolltest nur nach dem Rechten sehn'
The way you turn me on I can't sleep
M3: "do you think you could drop me off there? ..."
But Queen Frost only whispers
They say we're going in with the day light
If you really, really wanna-kah, have a happy, happy, happy, happy
And you can't find your car
All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
The army's on way the army's on way
Look who's tellin' who what to do
Mwahahahahaha! Welcome, boys... Come right in.
They can take control over your heart over your mind
I don't need any pretense; just hold me and feel me.
It's way past midnight and you travel through the city
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Here we are hanging on the strains of greed and blues.
(Llmame!) Y si chateamos por el Messenger?
City living heavy trouble city living rough we are given angry hearts but
Said I'm gonna get through this
It said our family fortune lies within our hearts
Donne che so che non conta l'etÃ 
I'm a bit complicated for such a simple guy.
You've really got a hold on me
He took a day off work to build a giant paper raft
Laat me in jouw wolken wonen
Raw, brutal, rough and bloody
Till it happens to you
In the stage of the lone headlight
Somebody in this bitch get me a drink. Im thirsty
And when I hook it to the left, it's like I'm bendin' corners
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Don't let 'em get to you
The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires stroke his precious pavement
Sacrificed our future, crucified our past
And he doesn't have to know
Well I'm happy in November
You get the best of me
But all I have are memories
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Sqwad
Uhm give anything if she would take me back
Que me tienes a mÃ­
Oh no you don't wanna know what goes on when I'm on my own
The way that you look.
I could learn to tame the clouds
Why is the sequel never the equal?
Go spiraling down as you catch your breath
three nights alone would feel alright
To bear it to dark Calvary
(I know the struggle's hard but you gotta keep fighting gotta keep going on)
Or just ignore this quick disguise
This is love on the run
We'll both laugh about this one day
Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
The RIM SHOT sound like someone gun
Y yo no recibo ninguna
A whole clip at the world, because it's us against
And become another statistic for the rest of us to hear
I just wanna play a board game
and shawty did some thangs
We've got families and mouths to feed,
It's a free ride when you've already paid
You made a really strange face
Won't you come to me with you
And I poured you some
I turned the world and I slept alright
They can't see everything on earth
in my American Apparel underwear
I thought I knew who you were
Why must the summer always turn into the fall?
Run a mile, run a mile to the river
Deeper and deeper you fall in a trance
I'm the one leaving you (x3)
And that it drowns the tender reed
Stand right there, stand right here, see if something happens.
? up the glass is shatterin, bitch it ain't matterin
Do you think you could sign my shirt?
She da first female solo to ever go plat
God sent Ehud to save the land.
To the things that I must say to make you mine
In my champagne glass, you know.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Trying to tie his high top shoes
I could go cruisin' but I've had enough
Yes, I think you've been cheating on me
Ve por el tiempo savin es ahora
See here lives a bitch and bitches come and they go
There's things we might discover
You know what she's meaning
C-4 your safe and you'll never grow old
Karen, may I see your blue eyes
Hurry up 'fore she spank shit (tires peeling)
I really want to see you Lord
Shit just wipe down my windows,on the side of my jag
A little boy tugged gently
A little too fast, or a little too soon
And use his fake friends.
I walked away from the grave
The sweetest piece of lovin' any girl ever had
I would be better without you
When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me
& now I can't find my way back to you
It's not who loves you as how much do you love
I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
She gives with every, every little breath of her beck and call
Nigga done dig and brought to the light
Ich war total in ihrem Bann
This does not feel like home my friends are far away
The stonemason does all the work
Why should i feel this way
They down with Ronell McDonnell
There are those who find these times a crime and those whose souls will never mind
With some James Dean in his eyes
Don't say it's over, it's so not over
(Oh, how long is forever this time?)
The scar becomes the truth
But your white dress, gold band, silver frame and photograph
I'm nobody's fool, 'cause you'll only fool yourself,
That touches the heart in many directions
I've found my happy place is on the ground
Tell me I'm crazy, say it won't work out
But I don't think that we're gonna go.
Round, round, round we go
Throw on something mad provocative play with the top lock
My mama house was in the middle of the street
I'll do this my way now
I just know what to say
And I'll spit the A R Hand Gun till my hand numb,
But so I gotta catch her first
I can't hear you anyway
And it's long hard road we've known
But I had to turn her down
How 'bout you, how 'bout you?
My hair tied up I'm starting to cry
Yeah, I've been wrong for so long
(Tell what he was saying
which he does. so for the first time during the mission,
Always the first to argue
I'm drinking till nothing left too
Damn, I gotta leave that shit alone
I wonder what I could say
They've seen this face a thousand times
You want what you can't
Packin a mac in da back of da ac
I can start to believe that's what you need from me.
If you don't treat me right
But I didn't listen back then
Put a little love in your heart
Wrong or right, you held me up to the light
I know her heart is breaking apart
Where our eyes are never closing
And it's hard to shake
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
So take me by the hand I'm on my knees
Why don't you find time, and realize
you told me you wouldnt ever let it out
And now that I've found it
Perhaps it's the aggravation that I kept in..side of me
Land and sea, the air, 3 stars
With a ringin' still in my ear
Corleone is known to be stoned
An avenue of broken dreams
Running about in a daze in the heart of London
Our real test of strength is caring
Correctly connecting, craniums crumble down
You're the 8th wonder of the world
This is the life, the life
And the nucleus of everyone has disappeared
There's a reason that he did what he did
We had a love most people never know.
Look good on my posters, the yacht is the dopest
You tell me that you've had enough
So I let go, I leave it all behind
You don't know about love
Throw me off my land, not
We don't care, we don't fight
When the face is in my face
With your telescope eyes, metal teeth
You're an outlaw once again
yeah, dieser song ist einem mädchen gewidmet, die nicht mehr bei uns ist,
Y en todas partes yo vivo, entre mi vida y la tuya
Underneath the streetlight, no, waiting for the shit to go down, oh, god
Some of them want to be abused
In the back of the class that you thought was gay
Only surfaced for a companion,
For all I know they might decide to raid shiiiit
But I'll just keep my mouth shut
Skip the youth, it's aging me too much
But no way no way
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Don't want to forget where you're from?
Yuh hear mi love it when mi talk to her
(Oh, we dance in misery)
It's visitin' day at San Quinton
que sea tronado si me besas
Not caring where the cops are
She labored so hard in this world below she didn't have things that most mothers know
While the third knife gazed into the heart of men
'Cause you can't pull out the circuits
And she's the wildest heart I know
I'm never hidin' this light away
Why don't they just let me live (Why)
I'm the one the Lord has chosen for you
'Cuz while I smoke this up, I got coke to cut
This phone call is seducing you, my voice is like SWEET Medusa
So move with the movement, movement of humans
The sound of Musik -
No ocean or mountain can keep us apart
Well I get paid every 24 hours money and the power
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru
I am Ramona A. Stone
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
You didn't listen to a thing you heard
Youve got to believe in yourself, you know you are
Er is maar een die jou kan beminnen
Knocking on my window talking loud
Any road I take is leading me here
Mad dog bitten by a crocodile tooth bite.
Knows all of the names
Take di middle an (wine gal)
You keep cutting me short, and you always put a pressure
Smooth like Johnny Cochran, I keep it movin through Brooklyn
Y El Autestima Siempre Va De Fuego
We are alive because You died
The fecting and the shooting
Trying to hate from my mind, I am
I gonna bide my time
Blowin up my phone like a welfare hotline
Well, it sure looks like
And I refused to just wither in place
You're flier than your stylist
Black Chucks, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
The mentality of the black male
All you give is pain a curse upon your name
(you'll know it's time to get gone)
Who's gonna greet me at the gate
I always hope that you will see me
I understand the father son and Holy Ghost
Got every right to hit the road
But the only thing I know is that I've never known someone like you
A love so deep, a love so strong
I need your love every day
Per ogni mia parte che ti vuole, c'Ã¨ un'altra che retrocede
I'm from the hood player, check my photos (my photos)
Obie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the
All the same in love and war
A Heart of gold losing only all he can be
I thought it'd begun hailing but amethyst and glass
Now go but the soft drink
I'm safe at the plate, take it away
Baby, are you feeling me?
'Cause she just, she just dumped me
She won't have to look too far for sympathy
But now, I think I'm ready for love
Dieses Geschenk werde ich annehmen
Mommy, I know you know the truth.
Ti ricordi quando poi cantavamo insieme noi
How I can't afford to lose you now,
And the border bums never saw
You ride in a what (what's up), don't get it fucked up
If you bring that don't make you stop
Sensation in my body feel life never tires
Forgot all about his faithful friend
Tonight will be a brilliant show
Eatin' lobster tail, like they fuckin' chicken nuggets, yeah
Coffee pots, and bottle tops
I don't like it here anymore
How many times can I sit here alone?
To be snuffed like a flame by the hidden hand of fate
You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals
Which defies all earthly descriptions
Cause you know I'll want to die.
Say b'wana she no home
Friends say they'll stay with you
There aint no losers over here
When he came to read my rights
Struggle is perfect. All that is here is for good
Oh I - I wouldn't cheat on you
Goin' down the steps on a white line
Ich nehm' 'n Zug von meinem Vaporizer
Will decrease when I step into your sceneries
I want to make you feel my love
For the world is the target
Can we grow out? Whoa
and make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
Go all the way up
And death will be my final lover
We'll be back next month
But you haven't got the nerve
Yo the Boogie Banger bringin danger to the rap game (no doubt)
They said, we know all about you
In the night it's haunting me
friend, Free you from sin, yeah
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Beast from the East part 2, coming to see you
He got caught with his own pants down
SÉnÉ eÅq oxuyanÄ±n ruhu sÄ±ÄmÄ±r bÉdÉnÉ
You gotta give it a shot
I couldn't say you didn't warn me
Si see'est un ami, donnes ton pain et ton vin et ta vie
Time wasting style, of their own
The dreams she shared will never be forgotten
I've got a dollar (fifty) (fifteen) and nothing better to do
So wide, so long, so sad I want to be strong
For the rest of our lives
Quin esh al que tu quieres besar?
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses of science
She f*ck so good see I taught her boy
Before I had the deal I was out here with the yay
Estaba la mesa llenita Â¿que erÃ¡ aquello? Â¿espÃ­?
"Away from me cold-blooded woman
Where are you gonna go...
Comin thru wit my crew like this
Elegant taste and money to burn
He's only a pawn in their game
A room full of real live genuine rednecks
Now what you got for me Sean?
when girl i know i am the right man for u
Sungeki no namida wa sono mune ni todokanai
I admit that I was wrong
Built by hand on land people slaved for
No one hear's ,but me ,your memories.
You wander lonely to the scene, a-crawling up the walls
Mas eu sou um anjo, anjo
Many lifetimes have passed in a instant reminded
and the things you do
Won't you help me, Dr.Beat?
Do you think that I'll be waiting for your love?
Make now the best time of your life
When will the good people have their say
Now it's time to shoot, knife, strangle, beat and crucify
i'm bringin them back again, for sho, for sure, i kill them in contour, s*** on you cow manore
To the hood, parked crooked behind that chained fence
Ahora te quiero why ahora no se
Dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
Birded murders with a burn gurshin a peasantry
Well I'll give him some food if he's hungry
It's such a strange strain on you
Caught up outside the light
leave it up, leave it up, leave it up!
So here's one for the road
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone
Esperar es matar el fuego, que por ti tengo en mi pecho
Dem get all rowdy when mi give it to dem
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
If you and I can compromise
Reach out (reach out for me.)
tu mejor cmplice sin condicin
I knew from the start you would always have my heart
Love the way we doin' Hip Hop
Jos vain tietisin mist etsi
Yeah, I know you, we from the same town and shit, but we ain't that deep
If lust is sin then what price our extinction?
When Im on top, look at me now
The moment I leave his side
And now I'm on my way back home
And our love goes on
Dancing on a Saturday night
My heart is mended, I'm whole again,
I don't want to live without you anymore lots sometimes
Screamed out for help but you were gone too far
Sometimes you have to hurt for the 'cause to be reached
Come on and pack your blues away
Shaking like they're burning, lemme put a fan on it
Be my head and I'll be yours
Oh my mind please give me a dream
Just like they did for me
Tal vez fumando te encuentre en el tiempo
I wanna laugh out loud
I ain't got a lot
Two hearts that beat as one
But I'm wide awake so I roll on
Ridin' low like a ese
Well I never thought Id say I was in love with you again
No matter what sign you are
A pawn in my masterpiece
How we wonder, how we wonder, watching down below
Prevent this beef from buzzin'
Heaven must be missin' an angel
thought that you was feelin me, you was tryna get rid of me
Oh let's get a little wild
Going out of my mind following you...
Cause you were the one who let me know that true love is genuine
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
I guess I'm saying you're the only one
From sunrise to sunset since the day i was born.
Don't be in love with the autograph
'Cause trick don't give a fuck when you coward niggaz now
I've become in control somehow
I'm playin in between the sheets in my jeep
I've tried, to stay alive, in our bed, in our heads
Eu preciso ir pra ver tudo ali
I'd like to think I wouldn't die for you
Ya tu sabes, en tapa-rabo, mama
Far from these savage lands
So gimme love, gimme, gimme, gimme love, love
He's gonna do in 5 lifetimes
Oh, sweet little sugar talker
Saca lo de arriba pa afuera
Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
It's growing night, we've got no lights out on the bayou
Tell me when will you be mine
Can only be quenched by our freedom's desire!
Be we bare our teeth
Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners
But I'm perfectly good at it
He was someone that you could talk to
When you 'Boomin' for years, users want to kill ya flow
sunken into the same place
Why'd it take so long to see the light
You are faithful, God, forever
You'll pardon my haste, I've no time to waste
I don't need you to judge what I did
Have you got my number?
It seems so loud (x2)
Oh now the white is red
Do you wanna, I was thinkin', would you care.
This what it's all about right?
When I get the courage to know somebody new
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
(Still) after all this time
This is a song for everyone of us
And everything to make it seem
As part of the healthy back and forthÃ¢??
Hes black and hes famous
All Your love is, oh
Spit flows rip shows peep the recital
One hundred percent gangsta, don't make me have to pull your card
And you were laughing circling the road block
Everybody's got to be together
That drip drip drip is making me drink/That drip drip drip is making me sick
If you do then forgive me
So me and my girls headed
Too young for me she want Sosa, shootas in the Range Rover
I've tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
I did it all for you
But having to admit this one has me
Sometimes they laugh and say that they have no time,
I never know where to turn
Yea (You got to love me)
Each day I make a stand
Yeah I just wanna hear it over and over
Contigo aprendi del sexo,la malicia del amor.
Don't give me no lip, 'cause I'mma done on your tits
Can you see all the pain behind my smile
We pluck polar bear winter on my side
I keep praying Don't forget it Baby, we keep the faith eternally
Cause I'm already at the red line
Baby, I can see us touchin' like that (like that)
Get funky, get funky tonite, get funky....... Let's get funky tonite
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
But I know it's a chance I've got to take
Cause boy its in my nature
"Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
The cracks in the walls that shift and sweat
I don?t want anyone new
Was all that I could take
Just to hear you say that you love me
You couldn't trust him but you never said no
Yeah yeah, how how dare you hide from me?
(ya see they say) thats not right
Why d'you always have to dance all night?
Love could be good or bad or in between, but this much I learn
Je veux chanter moi aussi
It seems that you can never ever make your mind about it, well
Ah, tuve tanto y ahora no me queda nada
Do you need a place, to stay?
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
Nowhere to run wound up way too tight
Baby let me conversate you just for staying 'round
Begin my ascent to the sky.
This is what we're waiting for
But you're there in my mind
You never learn I have to teach you constantly.
All I need is everything I want
For every heart you break
Everybody got the munchies and they ain`t tryin ta miss
I've got a brand new hate for you
I set the tone, even if it bugs you
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
Encased inside the gauntlets hung in quotas
Something I could look forward too
That you will keep your love for the world,
Where the troubles of life all the hustle and strife will go by
Don't look far 'cause I'll be gone.
Turn away, find a way, your own
ie. from your pedestal come down and
Listen for this reason, before it gets too late
I sat there in front of the screen
Yes I can see it all just looking through my glass
a todos los hombres mami le encanta
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the ocean
A big fat flagrant hoodrat hooker
Desperation before I hit the ground
Let me bang em with another killa, then we put a couple bottles on the chiller
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
My love is ever where you are
Watch! I'll even cut off my finger
Locas con mi estilo y la forma en que me expreso
When all that's between you and I is the air that we breathe
Hey hey hey hey hey it's true
Is how to be civilized
I can see clear, I've waited too long
A soldier lies wounded still
I don't wanna miss nothin'
Terwijl ze slapend met m'n kussen speelt
If you don't got money, don't fuck with us
Dope, I smoke it but not everyday
So baby, please don't go away. I'll do whatever just to make you stay. And in the meantime I'll just wait.
I stay late tonight right
Disarray, why feel for you
He thinks she drinks to much
What a rush she's rocking me slow
Well, I thought things were gonna be different
No te sirven mis sandalias
The reasons that I loved you
Fuck you if you ain't fuckin' with me
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang
Living ain't easy at all
Show me how you get down
You just keep on hurting me
'Cause in my hood err nigga gotta eat
The verse is shouting out and ringing in my ears
From here I can not see
Oh, I love you 'cause I want to
She's scared scared of letting go
A change that I would not
And I am sure without a doubt
I told her like oh darlin'
At this party and shit, motherfucker wants me to rap
I pray You, send Your power, Holy Spirit fall upon me
Nobody wanna struggle at home
Take your time, nothingness is something
Wos weadn denn mitt'n in da Nocht,
Listen! You make this bad blood rise
Word from me you clockin' the Yay
If you really love me then why are you leavin me
But I don't guess I'll change my way of life
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky
Living out a dream I've had
You stood by me you didn't doubt me
Voy de la mano de la noche hacia ningn lugar
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
We shall rise once again and let it be known
That was you across the yard
So let's get dressed and dance away the night
But I knew she would
Falling precious metal to suck out her soul
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
Babe, I'll stay through the bad times
Oh you look so pretty
And when we've breathed our last
Voy subiendo con mas movimiento
You Are The Future World
All I got on my mind is you
For the things that I have done
It was cold when I came over
And find some new songs to listen to
I need to hold you tight
And if you fell in love will you hold on to it
When you shine at me
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
And this is why, I can't see you no more.
no es gimnasta, pero conmigo es flexible
And you don't like what you're going through
Floating upstairs with a kiss in mind
Annie waits as the last
bring it up slow [hydrolic]
I can be your nigga but you can be my shawty
You bring light to the darkness
You got to listen to your heart
Well you ain't got my faith
Well fancy shirts and shorts of plaid
Spit chorus, bitches can't ignore us
Seguire mezclando ganas con alcohol
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
The industry; don't mention my fucking name
They were married in September back in 1969
Where did I go wrong
I have the strength to endure because, because
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready,
In the back of the buzz,
Baby it's how I roll
And it's how you embrace
Did I, did I? (did I, did I)
Hey you, big mood, guide me to shelter
we're dancing to the dark side of this tune
Since you opened up, I know you're hopin' it's wack
(Don't piss it all away)
cause I won't live forever
Yine seni ben ben beklerim
I leaned back on my radio
I just can't tell you,
I dreamed we once held hands but I awake
Sometime you just can't have it all
Easy on your saddle, fuck er from the back
I don't what you got
The fire that is burning
In your face (come on get up)
que me suba a aquella rama
No offense to y'all, but I feel a bit gifted
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Vivre sans penser au lendemain.
Comb your mind for the treasures of the soul
And still got bills and employees to pay.
Details can somehow slip your mind
It was April the tenth
But I only have two hands
On the spread, on her bed at her momma's house
A who di gal dem a cry for
I think it's better to view it from a distance
When you go back in time
To bickering they were so proud
Y si no encuentra manera
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Orgullosos de ser latinos no importa de donde
You still won't know what to say
'Cause what's a kiss? A kiss is a kiss
I'm a jester in your dramas whimpering for your affection
I've got all my money
You say my love's too heavy
It goes a little something like this...
A little boogie woogie In the back of my mind
He's well hung and I am hanging on
I find it hard to carry on
Da freak, da freak, da freak, da freak, switch
And if I do or die, I sing a lullaby
Acting like you aint got no trust in me
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
I'm still hung up on you
And solve all that you can solve before your mind dissolves
Ay, I, I, I'm broke man, I swear I'm broke
Got you wrapped up in my arms
It's a game of give and take to make it through.
Though my world has gone awry
Oh, I know it's gon' get better
They're leading me to places decorated in flames
We say go! Go! We're at it for the fight we know the drill.
if it seemed that i had my self
I'm wakin' up in the mornin', with problems on my mind
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
It's a long long way
They draw you in you hear a siren call.
Like every single day, really doe
Wishing its a bad dream cause usually never happens to yah.
I like it like that, I like it like that, I like it like that
When loved ones are near.
All alone on this road
and we'll take a step somehow
Well slow slow down, or so I'm told
To have you here beside me and to feel your warmth so very close is what I need
Babe a sky scrappers not too tall
Being vegetarian just ain't quite my scene
If I could disappear from where I came
Say the word and I will be your man, your man
You know there can't be love without antropain
I never slipped yo I got my grip like a handle
In our hearts without chains
bak to da topic of big big cash, everlasting gobstopper last last last
And I know how bad it feels inside
Or the smell of her perfume
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Soon as I get right I'mma take care of you
Bobbed your head up and down and got a crick in your neck!
Keep your aces up your sleeve
When you see me with a smile on my face
The rules do not apply (They don't)
He might be able to drown the portion of his mind
And I refused to quit
Now I suspect these songs are about pain and strife
That once you looked through,
Is the white flag of surrender
The more I get to know you, the more my heart rings
Lying ass, play the judge with your crying ass
I've been feeling you all this time
Don't let the good times fade way.
I want to feel you breathing out and in
Who's always been on your side morning and night?
I, I wanna go to shows, I wanna pierce my nose
I'd be sure we'd not sever
I am in your heart
Oh no, why, why before my life comes to an end
When they let you down on cue
Even when I was signed
but I bust him in his grill
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
White is the sheet on your fine linen bed
You came in my life and the clouds are gone
Like the wind blows, together
Don't know how much more I can stand
Life rises, now here we are
She put her arms around her and said, it's okay to cry
Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
You're more beautiful than ever
Love me for bein' me 'cause I can't change it
How I lived my life for you
Graceless lady you know who I am
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
When I wake up early in the morning
Still, I want you to love me
And I know what I must do
I did more than I imagined, tours I couldnt fathom
The ringmaster calls you down
Well, you know it's like I said
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Custe o tempo que custar esse dia vir
Mit 13 wollte ich schon nichts mehr einsehen
Take a good look around
I hope we don't collide
On and on, reckless abandon
And instantly miss a beat create a symphony
Years pass and your life goes by
Look in my soul, girl, its torn all apart
Carry on my wayward son,
And I'm a little afraid
You think your name is pass the joint
You're a stranger my, oh
Oh, how you made my whole life shine
I just breathe in, I just breathe out
a ring around the waitress from the verse
Here in our little world, the tiny world spins for me
Fuck with me you'll be deceased 6 foot underground is where you'll be to say
I'm paperchasing, trying to get rich
"Every word is lethal" "Dilated expand"
They ask their mother, what will they be
If it makes you feel good
Where was that masked body
And I think about you night and day
With a song of praise to sing
thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby, yeah...
And the soldiers that we hated were all dead or criminal
I got a plot to get richer, take my picture
Ready to set it off, I keep 'em blind and lost
And when I'm finished, your whole world's in flames,
Life is only a race
I get this feeling when I wake up late at night
And gets host from my block to your neighborhood
I put my ass on the line when you walk by...
I've come to need your company
She keep claiming she drunk, baby blame it on us
And I thought it was me and you who gave it all
You better run, better run
For I can't help falling in love with you
Y no me botes de la casa
We caught the outlaws and took them back to jail
My shelter through the storm
And television with one-way vision
You gotta love somebody, love them all the same
Oh that's the right time
Flatfoot Sam, he got him a job
You were all i had
And I won't let you go back
It's doesn't matter about yesterday
We teach girls to shrink themselves
Build me up, build me up
I'm lucky to share his bed
your love is like a soundtrack
It's so easy to run but so hard not to look back
Cause girl you give me tightest hold
Master mind maniac and a menace soooo
'Cause you're invited to a wedding and to share the dream
I know exactly what I'm gonna do
(You can feel so right)
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
Well you can celebrate anything you want
You see that look in my eyes
The we grew up to be bored
I know where she hides
To be so far away from perfect, that's all I've ever known
Mixing crimes with life enzymes
it's the best game you can name!
Say a word out of line
And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up
A couple makes what could melt the snow
of 2 boys, 1 box, 1 dog
You're like Jordan's on Saturday,
If war is holy and sex is obscene
Pull the arrows from your heart
you've gotta find that freedom
Especially now there's prostitutes on ilford lane
Your lies need to stop
Like the rain falls to the dry ground
You're a brother of mine
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town don't take your love to town
"Well how do I know
The work that we must do is
Und ich hab frei am Freitag und sie ist nicht da
Du hast nie gelernt dich arti zu kulieren
I sure hope there ain't beer in them cups
But that doesn't mean anything has changed
Everything is beyond my reach
And all they, never handle it in a calm way
Remember to kick it over
I can't get over you
And when the night falls, I fall too, Lady Sundown, ooh ohh
This time I know it's the real thing
Every little bit (gimme all that you got)
They say I'm 730, say I spaz out
Red eyes on orange horizons
Baby I'm on my way to you!
If you are a friend of mine
Flat on your back under a mean old man
Here's to them underneath that burning sun
We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Where that sliding scale still operates
You took part in the race,
Took a piece of you inside of me
Prove that you not a rat
Can you see the thunder
So Im giving you up
Was the blood on the floor and the love in your yell
Out of eternal dreams comes delusion
Pedal to the flo' with a 808 clap
To you I'm probably a light sadness
But, I'll keep it to myself now
Bad company and now you've been framed
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song
And I'll bet when they see me cry, they think it's just an act
Just a kind of MC who loves to harass ya
The very thing I hate
My love for you is all but new
Pop it like a six street Chevy
Leave it, girl, let's go
Love for you is real, if you leave ill live in fear,
Really want to try me, howl with the Fifth Dog
You've never been so real
Pra acabar com a paz que nos satisfaz
Stacys mom has got it goin' on
Yeah, I've got rings on my fingers
I tried to figure it out, got a black out
I'm scared I'll spend 20 thousand on some dope
My heart is crawling in the mud, mud, mud
If the change made was great
Why do you throw that ball at me
I got the world inside of my palm
If I could take all the anger and the hate a just give it right back to where it came from
Tensions so thick girl I can't wait
Around the kinda misery I find
He used to fly weekends
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?
The glory of this imperfection
I've moved along, packed up my shit
How can something so bad feel so good?
One last goodbye before I take my .45
There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Somewhere in that Wyoming wind
And if I'm asking myself why
This is how I feel
Blast from the past, I can see through.
I hear the music playing
and you can peel those eyes
All a nigga want is some of that lip service
All I need to breathe
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang
And when you think I'm finished, motherfucker I'm just getting started
You'll wish that summer could always be here
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Ich werf noch einen Kieselstein
You sent a shock right through me
And I'm indifferent to the loss
There are no useful drugs to escape from feeling numb
So turn in your grave
I think it's great that you've left me
I traveled 'round the world to find the sun.
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
I'm that nigga with the hair
Remember when we first met, I had to tell you that
He asked the reason why
Baby I lied When I told you I could walk away
No matter how good the food.
But I've got solutions in my head.
See that's how when you point your finger
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
You'll find it easy to be kind... Kind.
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here.
cant .. cant swam cant ...
