Hey, Don, let's go.
I don't think it's so bad at all.
Please, Rob.
I want 50 billion, not 20 billion.
Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars.
The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life.
Okay? But the word impeachment, to me, is a very, very ugly word.
What is it nowadays? Come on, tell me.
Under President Bush, in eight years it went to $450 more.
Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do.
This is your hat.
That's the first I've heard of it, that's the first most of you have heard of it, and then they pass legislation in various states saying that's okay.
Not lying.
I have middle of the road, I have poor, I have everybody.
This Conor lamb turned out to be a stonecold phony.
And she knows more about that subject, I think, than anybody, and she works hard and she doesn't need it.
Call me Donald, please.
But no, no, she's mean.
We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st.
Crooked Hillary.
They want the wall.
I did that heavy, heavy Pocahontas deal.
Build a wall, build a wall, true.
Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he's got the worst location.
So if you don't want Democrats to raid your healthcare, to steal away your money, to bankrupt your country, then you have a choice, you must vote Republican.
When Beto quit, he quit like a dog.
We could have been at 44%, if stupid people ran it, 8
I got to do it.
Yes sir, it's right up ahead, the guy's 30 years old or something.
It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman.
Look it, they just form.
That's a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area.
Congressmen Glenn Thompson, Congressman Dan Muser, come on.
That's a tremendous thing, because you are dying, you are leaving the business to your kids.
We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on.
You got to take care of our law enforcement.
I mean, they're seeing numbers that nobody believes.
He's the tallest in the history, but most importantly, he's the best.
Somebody else would have said, well, let's not do business.
We are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House.
We're going to call it a protest against stupidity.
We're going to take it.
Take it away.
We're down to, we will soon be down to 4,000 soldiers.
It sounds easy, it wasn't, but it was easy for me.
He always gets the name wrong.
Two months after president Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy.
We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days.
Actually, I think they're trying to take it away from Bernie again.
Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last spring, and we have ended catch and release permanently.
He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight.
He got zero out of it.
Think of that, ending the AIDS epidemic within 10 years that we've started.
What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that? One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State's Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham.
Okay? Free.
And then they fly to China, and I'm dealing with people right now.
President Obama gets the Nobel Prize.
She smeared US Service members involved in Black Hawk Down.
CNN fake news and the camera just went off, the camera.
For years, the sadistic mass murderer, Qasam Soleimani, planned and executed attacks against American targets, killing and wounding thousands of US service members and many, many thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of other people.
They're horrible people.
Can you believe it? That guy's in big trouble.
You remember, it was a really terrible thing was happening.
They hate it when I say it, but you know, honestly, they are the enemy of the people.
They were worse to him than anybody.
Asia's doing poorly.
We're going up.
I love that city.
It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it.
Sanctuary city policies aren't just wrong, they're immoral, and they're lethal, and they really are something that has to be stopped.
I bring people together.
Went too fast.
And from West Bend to West Dallas, we stand on the shoulders of the most courageous men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth.
What's going on is crazy.
It's so sad to see it, and that would happen.
So who did Biden put in charge? Beto.
You don't want to do it.
The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history.
Because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America.
It was based on illegality.
I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban.
They like us.
State senators Mike Testa and Joe Pennacchio.
I care.
It's called a protest.
They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders.
And you know why I add the word, he said, because they will take what I said and they will put it as a commercial.
You wouldn't have him running your business.
You better have a good year after all of that.
And I go before these crazy people, they're screaming like maniacs.
How about Buttigieg? Buttigieg.
Terrible people running that company.
What the hell is the difference, right? I mean, we are up, and we're up good, but I'd love you to tie South Carolina.
Don't be foolish.
They'd go out â€¦ your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money.
They worked for the Democrats.
And if we didn't have a good deal, you know what I would have done what? What? I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it, right? That would have been it.
Now they're all coming back.
I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China.
We're going to remember it, but we had in Michigan and in the country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, there has never been an economy.
Let's face it, Joe is shot.
The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed.
Trump, 33%
You can't see it down here.
They all take them back now.
The crowd was just, they want to see things happen in our country.
You know, we had, in 2016, I really believe it was maybe the greatest election.
Do you know who that is? Do you know who that is? Everybody knows who that is.
I didn't do anything.
We're not going to have another shot at him maybe ever again.
Right? We stopped payment and they called.
That's two.
These words will never be taken off.
You're going to have great health.
You know they're attacking a single man standing there with a camera, who never got hit and never hit back before in his life that.
No, I have an obligation to watch really boring stuff.
You look terrible.
And it's a shame what's going on.
He actually brought it further left.
We're not stupid.
But on November 3rd, Pennsylvania, will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before, or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn't have a clue, to kill the recovery, raise your taxes, delay the vaccine.
They got to find him.
Was anybody there? I did the commencement address.
Lisa? Great job.
For the first time ever, the United States is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal.
I've done this before.
You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything.
It is very tough.
And I love doing it with everything that I have.
Give you your tax cuts, I gave them to you.
But we've created 6
And considering that we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, spying on our campaign, treason, will probably be entitled to another four more years after that.
But if you can spend, think of this, if you can spend less money and win, that's a good thing.
I saved a couple of them.
While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart.
Above all, we will never stop fighting for this.
Most of you wouldn't do too good.
I don't know if you can, but, hello Des Moines.
But it's so disappointing.
Hillary wouldn't have had a clue.
No it does.
I was born.
No, he took what Bernie said and they moved way further left.
Okay? So what happens is this, we're working on healthcare.
I took a lot of heat, even from some of our Congressman, even from some of our Senators, but now they're all happy and I'm happy with them.
I had to because I had to show they're liars.
Okay? So it's actually more.
That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor.
Not easy, and they don't get support.
There's never been a time like this.
And we did the same thing in other cities.
We have turned it around.
You get a free curtain.
Don't talk to your dad.
You've got to produce a lot of product.
We caught them cold.
You call them suppression polls.
And I know your previous governor was a Republican, but I was not a big fan of his.
They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more.
We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business.
He's trying to buy his way back into the Democratic Party.
You better keep them nice and clean.
Nobody in the last 10 years.
Go ahead and I want them to do that.
Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American.
I brought back 650,000 jobs.
The outbreak was so rampant that Obama-Biden, the administration, told States to stop testing immediately, and they ordered the CDC to stop counting cases because they looked like hell, okay? We didn't do that.
It's your radical left people.
Global warming.
Okay? 15 minutes.
We took good care of him two weeks ago.
I'll tell you one thing, he'll go into Washington and he's going to have you in mind.
May not be great, but I will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age.
Go to Hollywood.
But I say, so let's get this right.
I just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because they're ripping us off on the internet.
You know it's under siege, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms.
I love the people.
Long as I'm here, they're not touching it.
Number one in the world by far.
This can only happen in North Carolina.
I can't watch me.
That's so nice.
Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal.
Mexico's paying.
And I took the heat.
And if you don't support me you're going to be so goddamn poor you're not going to believe it.
We've ended the war on American energy.
He was investigating the son and the son's company.
The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand- Message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020
It's terrible shame.
Everything is a suit.
But we would've had two and a half, three, three and a half million people.
Get used to it, because if that happened, you will see things happen that aren't good.
And we're running it better.
I'm telling you, if you look, it's like 15 years just down.
But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much.
Neuman.
He said bring back Gone With the Wind.
I see dollars going right up, but they need a good place to launch.
For many decades, our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests.
And we're leading with the Hispanic community.
Now that's only good for California, but these are the things we do.
So you come from Texas, you don't like religion, you don't like oil, and you don't have guns.
The bad news for the Democrats is we are more enthusiastic now.
Look at all of those cameras.
And it's about the fate of your country.
I must tell you at great peril, I used them seldom, but those are the times we have the best fun too, I will say.
Thank you, Adam.
Remember that?
We'll talk to you later.
Now think of it, three Democrats went over to our side, no Republicans.
We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare.
Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder.
He looked like it would be impossible to beat.
Even as a used ticket, you could probably sell.
Finally.
I don't want to get into a situation like where Biden used a record player.
Another man who's currently running against somebody.
If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything.
We won it last time, we're going to win it this time by even more.
It would have taken us 20 minutes.
Very few people.
Five for the wedding.
You might, yeah, you can.
If we're attacked and aren't doing very well and somebody says, â€˜Well, at least we have a good budget,' that doesn't work too well.
Not easy for any of them.
So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed, we'll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal.
The Democrats want us to fail so badly.
I think I remember the numbers.
We have one person, blood $39
With your help, we will reelect, and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration.
America will soon be thriving like never before.
That's why I tell you when we have the flu with 35,000 people and this one we have to take it very, very seriously.
And the word is that we're much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in Michigan.
Look, I can make this speech really short.
What we've done in a very safe manner is amazing.
It's being built.
Because we had designated targets that you wouldn't knowâ€¦ It would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible.
Well, from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids where I made my last speech prior to the election.
Let's always pretend you're one point down.
And we will have a very different country.
If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died just by that one move alone.
The polls have closed â€¦ and you know they only announce if you're very â€¦ if you're really going to win by a lot.
How good is Jeep? I've taken the toughest-ever action against China's chronic trade abuses, including tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese made goods, bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury.
It's 122 degrees in this place.
They grab her drink.
And a person with tremendous spirit and personality to put it mildly.
We're going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause.
Use drones.
Now, this is what's happening.
It'll be over.
I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot.
But you know what they have done? They've cheapened the impeachment process.
And I think they're having a big impact.
They're opening these massive, Foxconn in Wisconsin, they're opening these massive plants and it's hard to get people.
They just started up because they want to try and get me to be in Biden's physical level.
By the way, they gave us 27,000 soldiers on our border.
Remember Obama would send pillows.
I signed a law.
Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorist.
He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now.
How about this guy? How about Schiff.
Here's my problem.
When they do that, that's personal.
Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four.
Now we paid them a lot of money.
Thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April.
They are sick.
I'll be so angry at New Hampshire.
Well, we did it in Minneapolis, we ended it.
Most of it comes through, in this country, our southern border where we don't have the wall.
God bless India, and God bless America.
Thank you very much, Jim.
And they don't even know.
Remember North Korea? Remember? They were going to be at war with North Korea.
They're after your Second Amendment.
Right? She called him a racist.
She gave up a lot.
And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas.
And frankly, you know what it is? The whole country's doing the best.
He did great with this.
I've been watching it for years.
They did it last time.
Biggest difference.
I want to recognize US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster and Minister Jaishankar of India.
Get Jason in, he's a great guy.
I look up, the guy is already gone.
I got rid of a regulation.
Mexico has been terrific.
And Merry Christmas, Michigan.
He's an instinct guy, right? He's instinct.
Don't worry about it, it's not going to happen.
We will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus.
But Jason, you're in good shape, wow.
If you can't beat him in a debate, you've got a big problem folks.
Thank you, Sean.
I always say getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom is much less painful because when I read them off, I'll read like with James or with so many of the Congressional Medal of Honors, many are not living, to be honest with you.
He may be the next governor.
He's got like four people in a circle.
I don't know where the hell Derek is.
Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor â€¦ You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California.
People that never really thought in terms of it.
I have no railing.
We have given them, and there's a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why.
And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves.
Go to a private doctor.
Russia, Russia, Russia.
Russia, Russia, Russia.
Russia, Russia, Russia.
They're willing to give up their results because they think it will help them win the election.
I will tell you the wall is being built.
He's a tough negotiator, I'll tell you that.
Nobody has more respect for this offices than I do.
Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible.
And I just got a freeâ€¦ See these Democrats, they go out and spend $1 million on a poll.
And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else.
We are changing Washington.
I amâ€¦ And you know, it's going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election.
He copied my whole plan.
You can forget about keep and bear arms.
The source doesn't exist.
Thank you very much, president Trump.
All these things we've done.
When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it ain't depleted anymore.
10 days.
Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening.
But I got the people that we needed.
Always, yep, my word.
Cancel it.
Who's from Cambridge here please? Cambridge.
You'd have jobs, all of the problems that it causes.
You have to.
They've gone nuts.
We're not happy with China.
You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb.
While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent.
That'll be very good.
I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine.
They thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies.
Remember what I told you about those weapons, we don't want to use ever, we don't want to use those weapons.
And it doesn't matter.
Watch.
We believe Wisconsin should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.
Jake Tapper, today he put outâ€¦ Now I know you don't like him.
Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end.
He's a great gentleman.
300% up.
And I'll tell you something, Rush Limbaugh said it.
So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now we're making a record number of tanks in that plant and it's absolutely thriving.
They love me.
My knee, my knee.
And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them.
No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them.
180 million people will lose with what they want to do.
We have two great ones.
To uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge, I will soon be announcing that nominee.
Let's give them a hand, and thank you very much.
We're doing ads beautiful ads.
They're being protected in the State Department.
We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream and I'm fighting for you each and every day.
And left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God-given right to self-defense.
It was an assault.
Needles all over the place, everything else all over the place.
Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border.
I know the operators.
Because he was getting killed.
They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values.
He deleted everything.
Because they took a man who's got nothing.
Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady.
And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot.
It's time.
Know how angry it makes me when I see it.
How good are they? Lou Dobbs.
I never did.
I was going to say a normal president, but they'll hit me with â€¦ A little truth to that too.
Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know.
They're going crazy folks, they're going crazy.
They want to find it.
You're going to win.
You have a great governor.
President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed.
And now, they're building, what was that, like $6 billion worth of ships? And their beauties.
We have brand new missiles and rockets.
You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place.
It causes problems with the wife, but we won't talk about that.
Our military would rebuilt it.
They never did it.
Would that be okay? She was so easy.
Then she had 10 million.
Nice new ones, all built in the USA, beautiful ones.
I never had it.
It's rapidly spreading, hundreds of thousands of acres, it's not been anything quite like this one.
I like that beautiful red tie you're wearing.
I used to go around and talk about how everyone's leaving.
The fake news would not cover the equivalent of the Titanic.
Let us go in.
But he was a great general.
They overstay for years.
Everybody said it was impossible.
Yeah, the world, it's all over the world.
We built 127 miles as of today, 127
That's going to haunt him.
They want to be where the action is.
They're thanking people that I never even heard of.
That's why it failed.
We have done more than I promised, no politics.
I don't think that he's going to be the right guy.
We love being with you.
A few members of the UFC community.
And the Republicans have got it right.
The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we're having right now.
He wouldn't know what you're talking about.
We love this country, and we're not going to let radical Left socialist/communists take over our country.
I have to say this very, very unfair to my family.
The most unpopular part of Obamacare, and we almost have Obamacare gone.
No more catch and release, you think that was easy? And the big thing is that 30 footâ€¦ And this wall is built exactly to the specifications of border patrol.
Just in concluding, I want to say that America has always been a nation of pioneers and patriots, risk-takers and free thinkers, and dedicated workers who have honed a trade, mastered their field, and teach their children to always give their very, very best.
What we had last night was just incredible, in Minnesota.
Remember the flailing arms? Nobody noticed it.
Stop him from winning.
I'm telling you, Peter.
I've never seen that before.
This guy doesn't have a clue.
We have tremendous prosperity going on in our country, and the people in this room areâ€¦ I mean, you know what's happening.
Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump.
No, but think of it, as somebody saying that.
I mean, look, we're going to end this, but I have to tell you, John James can be so great.
Voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the Republican party with wide open arms.
But I went there and I went there a lot.
But you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they're going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff.
Will prosecute him.
Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much.
They should have stopped it and they did.
They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled.
This is the best version.
South Korea did very well with that deal, but I changed that deal a lot.
It was go on and then the show goes, started at ten went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two.
I call it Obiden.
When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support.
You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying.
We stopped giving them all the aid.
They just expanded.
They're going to take your guns away.
I had no idea that the swamp was that evil, but we're winning.
We instituted favored nations.
I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr.

For the first time, America is now energy independent.
I've been using it for the last year.
After the debate, he went backstage, fired a lot of people.
How about the insurance policy? To me, the greatest.
Is she related in any way to Elvis? I don't know.
What about sending out 80 million ballots? That's your real problem, and if Russia or China or these other countries want to cheat, all they have to do is forge ballots.
The fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign, even as a projection.
I don't have to do this.
So they put these big circles.
Weak, got a lot of weak people.
It was 13, then it went to 18, and then Mueller.
They had more crap on that helmet with night goggles.
Vice President, I'd like to know your feeling on nuclear warfare and how does that relate to China and Russia and where are they in the race? Well, you can't have this as your president.
Clinton, she was easy.
Great guys.
And we just created the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force, 72 years, 72 years.
So Yucca mountain, you're in great shape.
They don't want crime coming, they don't want to lose their jobs.
That was so big.
But we're having a good time doing it this way, right? Because we are finally putting America first.
He's been a friend of mine for a long time.
It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them.
We're very low in Iraq.
And we get along with Turkey.
You were one of the worst examples ever.
He gets angrier, and angrier, and angrier.
We give the Pulitzer prize to the Washington Post and all of these real sleazebags.
Remember I thought I could just build concrete slabs? They didn't want that because you have to be able to see through.
That's the important thing.
And I heard from the governor of Texas, great guy, Greg Abbott.
We're a great country.
We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing.
Promises met.
You want it, you sign papers.
Because the Democrats and the fake news media, it's a partnership.
Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables.
We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
We built the single greatest economy in the history of the world.
He's smart, he's tough.
Put up your hand, John.
In all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we're going to take care of those countries, but we are energy independent for the first time and that's a very good feeling.
Nobody cares.
I kept my promise recognized the Capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
They wanted me to sign for another three years.
â€¦ or anywhere in the world.
Many anymore.
I mean, they said that they'd never seen anything like it.
I don't think that's going to happen, folks.
Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds.
Rick Perry.
Nobody ever heard that.
Under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost $10,000, and that's three years, and it's going up.

As we begin tonight, our thoughts are with the two sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range.

We have great support.
Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please.
This is really great.
141, think about it.
But we could have.
You believe this? The border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people.
Hunter, it's so great that you're here, sir.
We want Trump, we want Trump, they want Trump.
We're the party of the American dream.

I think he just went up.
We made a great trade deal.
And they are available.
Sorry, senators.
They've already started buying.
The Democrats and Biden would be a disaster for Hispanic Americans.
And we have secured, soon to be three years, record funding for our military.
It's a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats.
And you know, the incredible thing, and I was with a lot of farmers.
She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation.
But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets.
So instead, they go into this horrible, horrible, really polluted water and the water comes out of there.
But no, he's a disaster waiting to happen.
We need our military for other reasons.
What does that mean? Joe, tell me.
It's 63 million, but it's much more than 63 million.
You are a legend, aren't you, huh? Great job you've done.
Hunter.
We're replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new U.
It's wonderful.

Well, that's a long time before I was president.
We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn't get along, I would not be here.
He's hated me for 20 years, and I've hated him also.
But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students.
So FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening texted the head of Counter Intelligence, Peter Strzok, likewise so in love he couldn't see straight.
We're going to see if we can get that done.
And they do badly.
Where are you? Hi.
You don't have that anymore.
It was terrible.
Just like crazy Nancy Pelosi, your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules.
Look what ISIS did.
Far left politicianâ€¦ I mean, they're fighting me on the wall, you have no idea.

The new USMCA has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan where they belong.
But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places.
These characters back there said, oh, that's okay.
We have televisions in the closet, on the ceilings, on the floors.
Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty.
But they smear you, they spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction.
His people, his representatives, because Biden doesn't know he's alive, let's not kid ourselves.
We're rebuilding our military, defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation.
And I guarantee you â€¦ And by the way, the states that are open are doing really well.
The guy never passed the bill, he did nothing.
He said, I'd really like more money.
By the way, we could do it in Portland in half an hour.
He's a superstar.
No reason for it.
5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years.
It took, you also had, what? A half an hour? Remember, they hit the CNN reporter in the knee? He went down, Ali Velshi.
They understood that, they understood itâ€¦ And by the way, there's nobody that knows our Southern border better than, I call them the Hispanics, I call them the Latino.
It's driving them crazy.
But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own.
They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in our schools.
And, I don't mean they're off by a little bit, they're off by 20 percent, 25 percent.
They are sick.
And we saved the industry because I got Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut back 10 million barrels.
Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.
They're waiting online for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ten weeks.
Is that these companies, these big public companies, they're owned by the people, they're owned by everybody.
They come home, mommy, daddy, this is what I learned.
A little bit slow with that head, Corey.
Our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed.
I want to thank some incredible people in the House of Representatives, and Kevin I want to thank youâ€¦ â€¦ people in the House of Representatives.

My life was so beautiful.
Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community and every walk of life.
Actually.
This was months later.
It sounds simple, but it was tough.
We're going to have the best ships.
I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob? That we're going to win it by more than we did.
Not a lot of people are watching.
Here's the thing.
It was like oh, you think about it.
She'll get hell when she gets back home with mom.
And right now, our numbers are higher than they've ever been before.
It was a made up statement, and they put it up in the form an ad, from a third-rate magazine, who's best friend is Obama, who, by the way, got caught spying on my campaign.
They are off federal welfare.
Remember when Shift made the phony speech? Eight times he said the same thing, except that's not what happened.
Good man.
But they're right behind me.
We've suspended refugee.
I'd hear women didn't like me, and I did great with women.

With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big â€¦ and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place.
It's interesting with women, so women want to have a strong military protection, they want to have strong borders, they want to have strong law enforcement, they want to have great education, they want to have low taxes for their family, not high taxes.
It was amazing.
We called up the commissioner and he was great.
Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin.
By law, they have to ask us to go in.
They use different terms.

And now they will say anything.
You can sit if you want.
Every one of them went around that flag.
I called Republicans that maybe wouldn't have been so inclined, some of them.
And by the way, there's a time to fight.
I was loyal to somebody.
Remember? Was it 1024th? Meaning maybe nine hundred years ago, there was a little action going on.
But let me ask you this.
That was terrible.
How about that one? It's a good one.
You're going to see.

What a great tribute.
We love our police.

Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid Medicare, force private doctors out of medicine, and lead to the rationing of life saving treatments.
They buy so much, good record numbers, soybeans record numbers.
It's like my job.
You know what and pillage.
We are the party of equal opportunity for all Americans.
I love Italy.
You can't open your store.
Oh great, Joe, thanks, Joe.
We'd take off with these absolutely gang members an we'd bring them back and they wouldn't accept them.
I'll tell you Rudy is amazing, but he did a great job.
So I have to, but I agreed, you know, I didn't know that no business or no business type show had ever succeeded on a network television.
The Republican party always will.
Come up, Karen.
He's interviewed me a lot over the years and I always got along with him, but they were tough interviews.
I guess they do watch us.
So, I had one of the teams in.
At stake in this fight is their survival of American democracy itself.
They gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier, totally disproven, totally fake.
Then, they don't like me.
Seven million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election.
These are the little things that I have to explain.
And I did it last time and people loved when I did it.
Here in Nevada rioters burned the city hall in Reno.
So we want to take back the House, we'll hold the Senate, and we'll keep the White House.
And if you would have had the other party winning this last election, instead of your market being up 72%
Very great.
And we have our great Governor.
But I know one thing, Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office.
We did so many things, and Rush heard this.
So, Democrat phenomena.
And America is thriving again like never before.
Leave it to something else.
So they went over the public.
And nothing happens to her.
More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay.
And I gave out the Purple Heart.
I did the rule and we got it through Congress.
We've rebuilt our military and we have financial strength.
Do we love law enforcement? And is there ever, ever a better place to be than a Trump rally on some night during some week? The truth, is we have a great time.
Normally you have to wait hours, unless it's a total runaway.
Look what we did.
I mean, this guy works day and night.
She calls me, Just one more trip, sir, one more trip.

Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history.
In fact I'm disliked, but actually they respect us, that's more important.
You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy.
No wonder you sold it.
Globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories, ravage our farms, rob our workers, and ransack our communities.
They don't give me credit for fake news.
Now they're sick.
I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it.
And the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative.
And he just told me our poll numbers are through the roof, he just told me that so I'll take that.
That's what they said.
When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair.
Now we're counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins.
You know why? Just every time you see an add from the drug company, they got plenty of money, that's why nobody ever fights them.
We've protected it, and that's going to remain that way.
We could forget Boeing.
The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for.
17 years.
But you know, we've created six million new jobs since election day and I couldn't say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it.
They became very, very famous.
I found him and we hit him good.
But there's tremendous potential to go up.
I love champions.
Pennsylvania, every one of them.

I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir.
It's real easy.
Look, I'm all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when you're close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things.
She is not the right pick, but she was my number one draft pick.
But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the Swine flu.
Everybody has good jobs.
Just to finish in the Middle East, we killed the founder and leader of Isis, Al-Baghdadi.
Just don't worry.
And together, we will make America wealthy again.
The only problem is, Scott, it's incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about.
They have a woman in New York who is a terrible congresswoman, you know that.
Does anybody know what that is? Right, you know.
And by the way, I look out, there's a lot of people that â€¦ Look at this.
Right Mr.
Let's go here, let's go there, let's go everywhere.
Well actually, we picked up two seats in the Senate that these guys never talk about.
People have been standing outside for two days to get in, so this happens.
I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually.
You know? We want their phones.
Election after election, politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the American worker, then they went to Washington and let other countries push them around, and special interests, buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies.
Comcast, terrible company.
I came up with that name far too early, I should've just waited.
Drug dealings all over the place.
They'd been doing it since you got in.
He was pathetic.
And we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders, a lot of your really wonderful people.
But I was at 269, so I went to Maine.
Because with Bernie he was able to get through.
And by the way, our country is doing great.
They're not really competition for us.
Got to be fair.
And by the way, we're trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we're managing it incredibly, but we're trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions.
This week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from Brazil and from Mexico for the rest of the year despite the USMCA, sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them.
If we didn't do that, you would have had three million people.
You've got Fredo and â€¦ That's Cuomo, Fredo.
We're going to make new trade deals that are like sane.
In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens.
All Democrats.
Greatest nation in the world.
Six.
My administration will be by their side through every step.
We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies and a record prosperity, even greater than last year.
We're not going to stand for it, and man, did we turn things around and we've just started.
But Corey Lewandowski loves your state, loves New Hampshire.
We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years.
I have to tell you.
And together with the incredible people of Minnesota, and you know what's going to be operating at strength? Because I owe it to these incredible mayors that were so nice to me.
But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better.
These are disasters.
Their warriors.
Biden didn't agree, he didn't, they just told him what's happening.
I hear everyone didn't like me.
We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country.
Sign this.
You have to be prepared for the worst, but hopefully it will all amount to very little.
Remember 8
They weren't even broken.
And then he was going to be able to negotiate.
It was all set to close.
And then they don't do the proper job.
And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do.
Ready? In other words, who do I want to run against? Meaning â€¦ very simple.
Look at those guys.
They did that seven times.
They throw it into the garbage can.
They'd say Trump has lost it.
Last year, the Democrat controlled New Hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state.
We'll see how the hell we do.
So we're re-filing it.
He was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of Americans, and hundreds of thousands of other people.
Congratulations, sir.
We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind.
I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this.
You know what you do? You hear it because you can't have â€¦ You know when sleepy Joe Biden, he's got the circles.
Is the whistleblower a spy? And who is the IG that did this? All he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down, the transcribed version of the phone call.
They can't breathe, aw.
He's right.
You know why they don't want a wall? Because I want it.
The United States and India will make our nations stronger, our people wealthier, our dreamers bigger, and our future brighter than ever before, and it won't even be close.
Good, I heard you did.
So Biden's put forward a platform that would end America as we know it.
The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East.
I'm going to look forward to it.
Great spirit.
The kid got $3 million dollars, 83,000 a month and he didn't have a job until his father became vice president.
We're going to find out.
We will surprise medical billing require, it's already done.
If we win, America wins.
Lot of guts.
But that was from North Carolina.
Hopefully everything's going to be great.
It's okay, because now the gloves are off.
Jim Marchant is a great guy and hopefully he's going to win and you're going to carry them over and you need it, you need it.
But the Democrats don't want the vaccine.
I can't be certain that many but it's a lot, okay? I always have to preface it because there'll be headlines, Trump didn't tell the truth.
They want to have all the things that we talk about, why wouldn't they want Trump more than anybody else? The other side is going to go the opposite.
It's level like this.
No, but he was the World Champion tree climber.
Biden got it.
But the military was great.
Look if you win, nobody cares what room you're in.
We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi.
Now you don't have to wait.
Since my election, we have created over 6 million new jobs.
We are defending your right to keep your plan.
They were incredible.
5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.
It went on for 45 minutes.
By the way, do you know what? I say it against the fake news, because you know what they're going to say.
That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing.
And, I did.
For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back.
She got it figured out, but most people can't, but she does.
Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots.
Andrea Zupancich, where is she? Where's Andrea? Thank you very much.
We have choice, we have accountability.
So I go home to our great First Lady.
But it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by Canada.
Unlike Minnesota thank you very much.
They have been so great, so they worked so hard and I just want to thank you all for being here tonight.
Wait a minute.
You have areas where there's so much water, you don't know what to do with it.
From poverty to prosperity.
We got it done.
I watched the Democrat debates, right? I watched them up there and he was so bad.
There is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, own and control.
They're already starting.
You're going to win on everything you touch.
Deaths went down.
Will I vote for the Democrat? The Democrat was so bad to you.
Bomb.
I'll take it.
And just hope they remember you every once in a while.
You own all these name name brand drugs that are making so much money.
Is that a fact? 175? I think he's on his way.
I'm telling you about so many other things.
They don't have any clue.
Just so you know, China's paying us tens of billions of dollars a month.
And if that's the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself.
Great leaders, and they love Texas.
I don't have a limp.
We're rebuilding our military.
With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment.
We're also joined by Donald, Jr.
I'm not going to do it.
They're not leaving anymore.
They advocate only economic surrender.
One wants open borders.
Down nine.
I get a call from the governor and Dan is there.
I was with a group of 36 farmers at the White House.
And nobody's done it like we've done it.
And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades.
It was like this.
Just tell them I don't want the planes.
They're only doing it to affect your November 3rd great election.
I understand that it's about your family.
Are we glad I ran for office? I think so.
We're so sorry he said that.
We're down to 2,000 soldiers in Iraq.
Long, long wars.
We're going to use both, but Keep America Great.
But I've warned the Ayatollah and the government of Iran that they must not harm, hurt, or kill any protesters.
I'm telling you.
Treasury but nobody's ever done this before.
It's now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before.
Emolument, nobody ever heard that word, emolument.
And the press will not write it.
They want to talk.
He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen.
Is that okay? I don't want to have a problem with men.
I'd be the meanest man in history.
I've never seen anything like the treatment that Justice Kavanaugh received.
So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here.
We really appreciate it.
They've gone crazy.
I'm the one that says open it up, let's play football.
What they do on television is so disgusting.
I never say this.
You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind.
And it'sâ€¦ Wait.
Joe Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the African American community.
Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they're too extreme to withstand any form of public review.
150 million! That means 50% of our country.
But we took care of the VA with Veterans Choice.
He watches every one of these rallies.
Remember President Obama? 28 times, remember 28 times, they counted them and there's much more than that I would imagine, that you can choose your plan, you can choose your doctor.
We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again.
You have only one choice.
And again, Tucker's been very good I have to say.
That's like one of many, many things.
Biden has called to end cash bail, you know that right, for vicious criminals? Meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else, you're right back on the street the next day.
No, no.
And, I like him, and we used to fight like hell, right? But, we don't fight anymore.
So it's great that we're getting them new ships.
It was a big thing.
But we've all done the great job.
But maybe that could be Rick, because they still don't have any idea what he got.
Say no and walk.
Why would we lose Michigan? Look at this.
You can't go to church, you can't do anything.
He'll just be locked up in a room someplace, and the radical left is going to be running our country.
We've tested now 25 million people.
Everything was negative.
This is the guy I'm running against.
But they still, so the New York Times had to put out a major apology, and they had to change their story.
Because China devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot.
We had the best numbers anybody's ever had.
The economic miracles taking place today are just beginning.
And Dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with.
Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country.
They couldn't even think about doing it, and they tried, although I don't think they tried too hard, bur they could have never done it.
When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard.
We can fire them now.
The lowest rate in all of America.
We're building a lot of ships now.
But I know we're going to win, so it's not going to matter.
Right here in New Jersey, your state's Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community.
We're working with your great governor Greg Abbott, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Attorney General Ken Paxton and senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.
And then the jacket comes off and you see these two little â€¦ And they go home and they live in a basement too, their mom and dad's basement.
And they don't want criminals coming across.
This is going to be big tonight.
We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life.
Are you having a good time, sir? I think you are.
That's what we have.
And he was jobless.
That was a great job, thank you, Kevin McCarthy.
Canceled culture.
She was like a dropping rock in water.
We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax.
Nobody's running against us in so many states.
And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll.
Like, can you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes.
In this region â€¦ â€¦ thousand soldiers protecting our border.
They're all going to come.
We got to go Republican all the way.
We've gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea, but you know what? If we don't win, they can put it back, and with the things that we did put in, which are many, many, many things, many things, our military, our vets, everything, with all of the things that we put in, it's like a tree, it takes a little while to grab on.
Now it's a disgrace what's happened.
If we wouldn't have closed it, we would've been talking two and a half or three million.
Only in Colorado could somebody say that.
I ask a couple of guys and I never really get an answer.
Richard used to call me up five, six years ago.
Biden- No that was really great.
He never won a point, he lost everything.
I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen.
That's what it is called, favored nation clause.
Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth.
I was very impressed.
So the Biden's got rich while America got robbed.
You know what's happening, you know what's going on.
I guarantee you that.
In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down.
We thank you, we love you and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day.
Good night everybody.
Only way.
Greg Murphy and Dan Bishop, they didn't choke, they're fantastic.
I tell this story all the time.
And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
That's never happened before.
This room wasn't designed for this many people.
Remember when Barbara Streisand, she's another beauty, by the way.
And here's the big thing.
We'll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year.
That's a big area, even in an ocean, right? It's massive.
I'm so proud of that.
They're meeting the President.
I haven't liked you, but to be honest with you, Mr.
What the hell, at this point, might as well, let them come on over.
That's what we do, right? So these really countries that come in, prime ministers, presidents, sometimes dictators, those we can't deal with too much.
She wasn't too happy with me last year.
But we can't let that happen.
And you can forget your tobacco industry, you can forget your farmers.
Well, let's see what happens.
It's us.
I hear good things, Derrick.
They grabbed them.
But they're very happy with their wall.
The average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country.
I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July.
They want to open.
Nobody going to mess with them.
That's not nice, even for me.
And you know why? Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come.
Was that the greatest evening? But I'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas, the greatness of America and the glory of God.
But I've been rough on them.
And I got it done, but that's the way it is.
We lost so much.
Diseases are coming back that this world hasn't seen for 30, 40, 50 years.
And veterans' unemployment has dropped to a record low.
By the way, I was endorsed by New York's finest and we're with them all the way.
And I got it approved about 11 months ago.
But you know what? The people can hear the crowd.
We want people coming in, but they have to come in, only they have to come in through merit.
We will never let it happen.
This guy you're going to have Portland's all over this country.
I used to be a believer in the other, but I think winning â€¦ It's like you're a track star.
In Virginia, they want to take your guns away.
I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years.
James is good.
Forget it.
I got a reel on him.
He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping.
The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe.
In three and a half years under my administration, we've secured America's borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio.
And Accountability.
Right up until the moment of birth.
This guy doesn't know he's alive.
My plan is to arrest them.
We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States.
The good news is we're having the best times in history in our country.
Right? Ain't that true? And she left the company.
So, thank you.
I'll see you later.
And this was one of the richest nations in the world.
They're paid for by outside stupid rich people that â€¦ They're stupid people.
All of them helped.
I love the people of Italy, but they were heavily infected.
That was a wonderful day for me.
Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise.
And they're seeing a spike.
We worked out deals with every one of them.
I'd like to say 20 years, but it's much more than that.
And in the Senate, other than Romney, we got 52 to nothing, 52 to nothing.
We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built.
Thank you, Lee.
The day I did it, and Tom was there, a man, I don't know who he is, he's probably in this massive audience, but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life, including at childbirth.
Oh, I didn't know I was in Wisconsin.
Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans, I was just with them.
It's wrong.
See the beast.
And I'll choose only from that list.
But we did a great job, it was an amazing thing.
The Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy.
We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it.
We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military.
It's also why we need four more years.
You can't do anything.
I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy.
It was a joke, everybody was laughing, but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second.
Now we have brand new jets.
Not nearly as bad as others.
See I put a tweet out because it's easier than making a phone call and talking for a half hour, thanks Brian.
So I came up with this incredible plan.
He's 100 and he looks good.
He did nothing and he got nominated.
I've been going through it now for more time than I've been in office.
We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, January 1st.
And they worked one job versus two or three jobs.
No, he signed an executive order shutting it down.
I never had that before.
We have a lot leftover, but we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America.
They call it loopholes.
But we're draining that sucker slowly but surely.
I don't care if he uses a teleprompter, you know what bothers me? That means the fake news is giving him the questions.
It wasn't a pretty picture.
Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy.
Today's Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed.
You know, I'm supposed to watch.
She said she was an Indian because she had high cheekbones.
We've confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
They don't like the gas.
Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb.
They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders.
All right? We're going to be doing it.
The Nittany Lions, they're doing pretty well too and the incredible American Patriots just like you, you are Patriots.
Together we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity.
Yucca mountain, please.
And it's my honor.
Instead I work my ass off up here, okay? Yeah.
Today, I like it a lot.
It was heading in the wrong direction.
They even have a provision where you don't have to verify signatures.
Under just three years of by administration, 3
We have ended that program.
Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for.
It all left the state of Michigan.
Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal.
Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier.
I want to see it.
Based on that, you know what? I never stopped you.
You see what's happening in California.
What a crowd, what a crowd.
You can't win Michigan.
Just leave it the way it is.
I really appreciate it.
And when you read about deportation and Sunday, we've got a lot of people on Sunday, but we have a lot of peopleâ€¦ and we're always shooting for the bad ones first.
I gave them everything.
I don't talk about my ass.
It just came out.
You catch them.
8 billion out their window.
But they weren't allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild.
You know what she's worth? Zero ratings.
President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.
We put a brand new wall up.
We got to straighten out our immigration laws.
He said it.
I like my foreign policy.
That crazy Nancy.
Thank you, Martha.
Thank you, James.
And Republicans will always support the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement.
That's Duffy, in case anybody â€¦ And they was running and we did a lot of work for him, and it was great.
And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world.
You have records.
Trent Kelly, Michael Guest.
He was off shoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military, and sacrificing your children's future to China and other faraway lands.
They had some rough times since then.
You can forget it.
We're friends.
Never happened before.
A shutdown we'll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of American.
Ben Carson, good man, he was down.
I hear we're doing well.
He seems to be leading.
Now, I don't want to give them any ideas, because they'll search all over the country for a vet who's unhappy.
After being set free the same criminal raped, brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman.
Forget the country for a second, you have the best economy you've ever had, you have your best unemployment numbers, you had the most people working than at any time in the history of your state, you have your best black unemployment numbers, best Hispanic unemployment numbers, best women unemployment numbers, best Asian unemployment numbers.
I'll be going to California tomorrow.
We want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, not to other very terrible forces out there, because if we win, very simply America wins.
That's the way they do it.
I mean, I get that too.
Communism's really bad.
Right there, and he's very far away from me.
Korea, I renegotiated the deal.
You've had presidents, they never put America first.
Tremendous guy, really successful.
Having a great memory, but sometimes you take little clues.
We'll be with the governor.
I don't know what's going on.
We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment.
But they're not looking for that.
They don't want to say it.
The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies.
President Obama tried, he couldn't get it done.
He said until president Trump came along, we were going, boom.
Check out Omar, check out Omar, get to that great writer, he should getâ€¦ Oh, so the New York Times won all these Pulitzer prizes, right? I was going to tell you before.
If I would have said that, nobody would have believed it.
We take care of the bill.
You know what that is, they choked.
He wants to get rid of your second amendment.
I mean, we're going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday.
Unlike Biden, I'll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement.
You don't have to wear masks, you don't have to do anything.
Oh, good riddance.
On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, and we're doing it.
I will let them have it like you've never heard before.
Joe Biden's agenda is made in China.
We had to do it, we had to do it.
We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China.
President, I'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created.
You got the perfect first lady.
So they're not exactly happy.
Don't forget, last time I talked, I said we're going to give you a tax cuts, I gave you.
No blood.
We have no idea, now we do now, but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands.
President.
Should I say it? Yeah, why not.
She loved doing it, she from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said.
And the only one I could think of is Ted, because he's going to get 50 Republican votes and he's going to get 50 Democrat votes.
That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way.
You focus.
Think of that.
Right? Except these young ones.
Under us, but we are building weapons, all made in the USA.
5-million votes, and we won.
Wonderful.
The largest amount.
I can tell you right now.
Greg Stanton.
Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody.
And Henry, please stand, please.
It'll be faster.
They want to kill our cows.
But Americans, across the political spectrum, were disgusted by the Washington Democrats, the partisan hoaxes, the witch hunts, the con jobs.
They're going to be here to get out the vote.
It's a very, very outstanding senator.
Weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs.
It was crashing.
Fred Ducette and Lou Gargiulo.
Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country.
Make it electric.
It's going up fast.
Then, they hid her body in a water drain.
The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force.
And our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before, and I hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3, and the USA was not on top, and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing, but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the United States men's hockey team defeated then Soviet Union team in the 1980 Olympics.
We are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we've done great â€¦ Look, until you get rid of it, you never did great, but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible.
You look at Russia.
00 to $25,000
Everyone's swinging or they end up standing up.

He really doesn't.
One protester, a very weak voice.

Hi, Steve.
Actually, in my opinion, the polls, they're suppression polls, they're meant to make people discouraged, Even me, I'm supposed to be discouraged.
They didn't have too much of a chance.
They're all going out to vote.
And you know that's hard when you have radical left running the city, all politicians, the mayor.
We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in.

Is that what you want? And then Ukraine, $183,000 a month, and a $3 million upfront payment for him and his friends, think of this, with no experience and no job, and they said, do you know energy? It's an energy company that paid it.

Crazy Nancy, crazy as a bedbug.

A, Japan, South Korea, Europe, when that happens.
If Biden wins very simple, China wins.
Nobody to this day â€¦ and the Republicans stuck together.
You always have to do the unexpected.
I know a guy who can't stand his children, they're horrible, horrible human beings.
Nobody can do it.
And by the way, that's because we got a lot of help from a guy named Scott Walker.
Your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before.
Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit.
And that's why the Supreme court is so important.

I just saw, New York Times, can you believe? Failing New York Timesâ€¦ When we leave in 10, 14, 18, 22 years from now, the New York Times will be out of business and so will a lot of others.
It goes on.
Chris? Where's Chris? The mayor? Thank you, Chris.

I'd like to apologize.
We're leading everywhere.
Tennessee has been incredible by the way.
You couldn't do it.
Meetings all the time.
I will say this, if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now China would become the â€¦ It would be the number one economy anywhere in the world.
Had I made that one damn stop to your state we would have won Minnesota.
The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay.
But you can't, this whole thing with the unsolicited, unsolicited means you're sitting there.
We'll see what happens with Iran.
The anniversary.

He never got more than 1%
So they were even so they're okay.
The best we've ever done.
They're working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they're making much more money and it costs our country nothing.
Now they're getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we've done with criminal justice reform and other things like opportunities, zones, et cetera, they're getting jobs and employers are loving them.
I had many, many years, decades of people putting â€¦ So I came.

You hear about Supreme Court, you know about Supreme Court, you know about other judges, by the way at the end of the first term, we'll be close to 300 federal judges, including court of appeals, which I think is a record.
We're doing really well.
How about 200? I didn't know that.
The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism.
These are phony people, but that's okay.
I told somebody, the evening newscasts, they're terrible for conservative people and they're crooked, they're absolutely dishonest.
The impeachment hoax.
President, very good and they'll say he was a great president.
You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
Because to be honest, this is a little earlier than the campaign.
There has never been a movement like this, and it began very early.
Tucker has been very good.
Doug and I were talking about it and they take out registered voters.
Never happened before in the history of our country and we're really wise to it.

I don't like them either, by the way.
What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman.
Not me, us.
We've gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from Obama, like the Paris Accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing.
We had attacks on dairy products, 297% tariff, nobody talked about it, with Canada.
They've cheapened a process.
You know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly? The legs, the arms, wiped out.
We are repealing burdensome taxes.
But we got rid of the worst part of it.
Do you ever notice, he's always calling it the other.

You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it's much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous.
Those windmills.
And the man that took his place is dead also.
But they're the party of late term abortion, socialism and corruption.
It's the wall that border security wanted.
Take a look at our retail numbers.
We don't fight to win.
The National Guard is fantastic.
And I talked about him a little while before, I could talk about him all night.
We're supposed to protect them and they don't pay, I say you can't do that.
500 million would be a lot.
Get rid of them.
Pennsylvania would have never happened.
Here's the problem, he doesn't even know what happened, I don't think.
The second amendment, if I weren't president, you know the pressure, your second amendment would be obliterated.
You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers.
And a man that should be your Governor, I don't know, he's doing well, but Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, everybody.
You want that.
And I want to thank for that, Steve Grammar, who's with us tonight.
That doesn't work well in Texas.
It's helped a lot of people.
So in conclusion, I have to say this.
What do you think, Mike? Five or six each.
She's driving me crazy.
They did a lot.
I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless.
You would have been in war.
They moved them aside, and they just walked right to â€¦ It was the most beautiful thing, and that would be it.
They've been very good.

Go home, Mike, and enjoy your life.
He was the number one guy in law school.
Our very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed and we're fully financed now.
It's too much.
But this guy â€¦ So I've had it a lot where â€¦ But sometimes it'll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds.
You know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call.
But we're talking about them.
We had a rough couple of days.
You remember that guy? Great environmentalist.
And you think that was easy? It wasn't easy, let me tell you.
Two of them.
Pocahontas.
That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus.
We got rid of it, so now you can leave your farm, your small business to your family.
They always show up with a mask and they're covered, because then they go home to mom and dad.
I mean, even if you're saying things perfectly, it's a Pinocchio.
It's actually two planes.
By the way, whatever happened to Hunter.
But no, we have enough politics.
But you know you wouldn't do it because he couldn't do it.
You don't have too many cows in Wildwood, but if you do, they're gone.
And we're going to keep it there.
But these left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil.
They had a poll.
Doubled it.
You get it because you can't be there.
Take it away from China.
Oh, isn't that wonderful? And by the way, the Democrats want open borders.
Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir.
5 billion dollars into auto factories in the Detroit area, creating another 3000 Michigan jobs.
Enjoy yourselves, because if I'm not here, if I don't win, I don't know where I'm going to be.
It should be happening in about the next 20 minutes, 19, 18, 17
I wanted to tell that story.
I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it.
Have to do it again.
US steel now, all of them, they're all expanding.
This is not â€¦ Look at that.
And our country will never, ever be stronger.
People come up to me.
You know, we're here for a short period of time.
Remember this, very simple to remember.
It's a big step for the Middle East.
And every year they'd have to come and come.
On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border.
Look at Portland.
And you know, you can go, all over the world in some cases, it was morning.
That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
It's fake news, and it's a disgrace.
And we're here for a number of reasons, but we're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a Republican state.
African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded.
That's a good thing.
I think we are.
But think of this.
It's unbelievable.
52 years they tried to do that, they didn't get it done, so we're doing good.
They're the best we've ever had.
We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed a wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism; and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world.
I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir.
This guy did the swine flu, right, it was a catastrophe.

You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for â€¦ I mean, look, from wherever you came from.
Hey fake news, how many points does he have right now, 15? They won't tell you the truth.
I kept hoping, but I think, honestly I think that sleepy Joe, crazy Bernie, I don't even want to put Buttigieg in, but I think they'd actually be tougher than her.
Right? That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God.
No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment.
He said we did nothing right.
Remember I got it down to 99%
I give it away.
It wouldn't have been as good as we have.
Thanks fellas.
I just see him sitting there.
This is a lot of fun.
So we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare.
A lot of people were against it.
This was a group and they knew a very well.
Joe Biden brought you only endless wars, I'm bringing you peace and I'm bringing our troops back home.
He's not going to do well here or there.

It's a word I associate with some very bad times in our country.
I don't feel like a politician.
But we're getting the hell out of there, okay? But the fake news doesn't tell you the right story.
Because despite the fact and nobody disputes it, that we've done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything, we've done more than any administration in history.
But thanks, Michelle.
No, they're right about that one.
But we would have been talking about â€¦ It would've been unacceptable, unsustainable.
And our devotion is to our Creator.
I hear it all the time.
He's surrounded by bad people, dishonest people, but they're very smart.
We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick.
I mean you never saw anything, living on their most important entryways into what was a great city, San Francisco.

A record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working, another record.
But that last hope that Biden will win, they will own our country, China, they will own our country.
Because frankly, if we kept the old practice which frankly, some people could dispute one way or the other, we would have been up in my opinion, another 10,000 points in the Dow.
And I hope the buyer of his house didn't hear that littleâ€¦ Steve.
They're great people, and they've done a fantastic job.
They're not good.
Guy.
It's been so incredible.
Takes too much time.
I should watch.
But Michael McDonald, I want to thank you and the members of the Nevada Republican central committee.
That's the problem.
It will be safer, it will be better, you can save 3,500 dollars, it will be less costly.
Pelosi makes it up, and she backs him up.
Why? Because I'm pro-Trump.
But in certain ways, I like this better.
She had no chance.
When we close the border.
But in just three and a half years under my administration, we've secured America's borders rebuilt the awesome power of the U.
But that was John's first crack.
This is crazy Nancy.
Right? We're never going to have a problem.
And you're against the oil stuff too.
We added that in.
You know, we have what, 10 months? That's a long way.
With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity.
With me, they don't even want to â€¦ They actually played it down.
And, I think they have an ulterior motive.
And she was 100% right, it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea, not for us.
Freedom.
It has to go, but it needs a littleâ€¦ That's why we need the four more additionally years.
Neil Gorsuch.
I don't believe I do.
I've known her for 25 years.
I hate to even mention the word and hope to God we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world.
I keep my promises.
But we have a good chance.
Together we're restoring this nation's industrial might and we are doing it with American iron, American aluminum, and American steel.
Democrats' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets.
We are one great America.
And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful.
Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever.
They wanted us to put drones flying around, taking pictures of everybody.
You got to get a little bit stronger than that, folks.
And some cheap pencils.
Three years, including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts.
I'll tell you what, I'll be so angry at you.
Handsome guy, handsome.
And I have to say this, we are far greater now than ever before.
Move it up.
Three.
Right? But we're going to keep it.
I never did it before.
But he did kill terrorists, right? And it became Harvard University for terrorists, right? But they did go after him, but he didn't knock down out.
No more.
I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail.
You know, he could lose Texas.
It's a great thing.
We're opening up the Space Force because you know what, that's where it's at.
They did well in the state.
If I ever become more popular, that means I'm not doing my job.
I got the Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Peace Prize, Nobel nomination.
They're taking them from this country, from that country, from that country.
They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.
It's two people tonight.
Do me a favor before I introduce a very special guest, I'd like to ask your great Governorâ€¦ You know, he won like by 16 points.
I'll tell you here, because you don't read about that stuff.
I will tell you that right now.
So nobody knew what the hell she spent.
The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable.
Oh, and I think he's like pretty light on oil production too.
You don't hear that because this is a blue collar boom.
They don't think about jobs.
Stand up, Mike.
She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th.

For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try.
We are so respected, you don't even know how respected.

I call it the Obama Regulates.
It would have been so much easier, right.
He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion.
This is CNN, Texas is in play.
Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp.
If it were up to sleepy, Joe Biden, bin Ladin and Soleimani, would be alive.
Does anybody think the media is honest? Does anybody think they're totally corrupted and dishonest? All right.
Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots.
Actually, I have to be honest.
And Greg Murphy was up a couple of points, and he ended up winning, I don't know, I'd ask the media, but they won't give me how many â€¦ What did he get? Do you know? Like 20, 21? He won by a lot.

My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty.
Because they all admit that we're doing a great job.
It didn't say 500 million, and it didn't say 250 like this Steyer guy.
And I called for a drug test, because you know what? I want a drug test, because we don't want to have a situation like we could have with this guy.

We're doing a great job.
And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built.
Should we get him up? Yes.
They figured, you know what we'll do, we'll get Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place, that didn't work out too well.

We'd win them all.
We've invested $2
And it's not just a little bit positive.
We did a brand new one with Korea.
It's the craziest thing, they love it.
Impeach Obama.

The numbers is like a roller coaster down.
The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics.
And RNC finance chairman, also happens on a team called the Chicago Cubs, I shouldn't tell you thatâ€¦ Todd Ricketts.

That's what we're doing right now.
And you've all seen the wall has gone up like magic.
Thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border, we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row.

She was so mean to him.
Sort of grew up with these people.
Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to reelect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly.
I did it because it's the right thing to do.
But it happened to him.
Guy, come up.
They use it as ammunition.
Numbers are good, right? Yeah.
So I did that.
They'd be talking about his bravery.
When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that.
They won't let you use it.
He's even.
The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan.
They needed help and they do need help with it and it's great and they do an incredible job.

We love you.
Four years, eight years, or in one case more than that, cut more than anybody.
So Air Force One, so that's the 757, but they have a 747, which is the big Air Force One.

We have to take over the House.
We're defending that right.
They're going to die.
Everyone's got deplorable.
They're making more money than they've ever made.
It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden.
How great? How great? But our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable Phase One trade deal with China.
But we've helped Puerto Rico and we've really helpedâ€¦ If you look at what we've done for Israel, it's been incredible.
Michigan, well, you know this one, right? Michigan gave us Motown, right? That's right.
I have poor guys, middle of the road, and rich guys, doesn't matter.
Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions, jihadist regions.
We don't show them anymore.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But the do nothing Democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed.
They always go back, most of the time.
And the DC police are good, but the mayor gave bad instructions last night, that should have never been allowed to happen.
I think you could be Abraham Lincoln and not win that particular race.
Not even close, not even close, it's what we're doing, we're doing it together.
It's okay.
So in the Republican Party, we know that police officers are not villains, but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe.
To stop the far left, you must vote in tomorrow's special election.
Can't do it anymore.
What are you at? What's yours? 100%
If I did last night's speech here, by now you would have all been walking out.
I can't say it because I got all these maniacs back there.

And I have to say this about the Republicans, the Republicansâ€¦ And you have a lot of great ones here tonight, your Congressman.
That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus.
And actually, and I'm happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me.
Congratulations on what you've done.
You're not going to have a country.
We're not shutting down our country.
You will lose your Second Amendment as soon â€¦ I'm telling you.
The 2020 election is about one thing.
Explain that.
Nobody what is, you know? I gave the A+ treatment.
There's never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now.
I see him at so many rallies.
The owner of the Chicago Cubs and he's in first place, so he's very happy, the RNC Finance Chairman, Todd Ricketts.
They really are incredible.
You'll be taking your monuments down.
He has no clue where he is.
And by the way, speaking of our military, have we taken care of our vets with Choice, with Choice.
It'll be finished very short.
But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky.
So we're doing it a different way, and Mexico is now patrolling with 27,000 troops.
It will never be better than what's coming.
â€˜Joe Hiden.
And, you have a good governor.
One of the fake news broadcasters, because this happened the other day, we had a tremendous crowd like this.

What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors.
I have a friend, a very smart guy, very streetwise guy.
How bad was NAFTA? China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Germany likes Obama.

Great victory, by the way, that was a great primary and a great victory.
We say that's not working because we're going up and he's dropping like a rock in water.

We gave Iran $ 1
Dan, come on up.
Not going to happen, we can't do it, and we have many other countries also, but we'll worry about them a little bit later.
Stepped on a nail.
Does that make sense? You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break, it's considered a hazardous waste site.
It was really 119
I hope you don't need it.
They're stronger, bigger, tougher, meaner, and actually better looking in a certain way.
They hit everybody.
Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and we're not letting it happen anymore.
I love you too sir.
They have spent the last three years, and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady, trying to overthrow the last election.
I watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics, and he was so bad.
Women for Trump.
You don't get to 270, it's over.
It's not beautiful.
They needed four senators and maybe five, and they needed help with some of the ones that weren't moving in the right direction.
You better remember when you walk into â€¦ you know, it's November 3rd this time, November 3rd.
Remember? I think Reagan won every state except for Minnesota.
We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any president or any administration in history.
â€¦ Did you see where Pocahontas is slipping, badly? Bernie, Bernie has gone up.
And we were going to go into Seattle.
Do you see what's going on? And it rains and it's filth and it's needles and it's drugs and it's, you know what.
With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%
It would all be over.
You're not shut down for riots.
Having fun.
That's a commonwealth.
Remember Gilmore? Nobody remembers him.
It becomes automatically the capital of Israel.
You see them all, they come out every day.
I really don't know.
I didn't see it, but I didn't see it, Donald.
The unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years.
It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd.
I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel.
We're the best in history unemployment for African Americans, best in history unemployment Hispanic Americans, best in history unemployment Asian Americans.
But they go the opposite.
It's turned out he doesn't.
You couldn't win.
For a long period of time, they were treatedâ€¦ You know this before I came.
I don't think they have enthusiasm.
So Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers in our history, Asian Americans, the best unemployment numbers in our history.
He's being interviewed tonight on Fox.
Those cages were built in 2014 by Obama.
They were cured.
They have ceded.
We won't even toy with them about three or four more times.
I believe that's true.
And you know what? Other countries, for the first time in decades, respect us again.
No, everybody wants law and order.
We need steel.
They fell way short.
Let me tell you, by doing this and taking this particular job, which I love, it will cost me billions and billions of dollars, but if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before, comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening, and pays $439, emoluments.
Too close.
Where did that come from? She's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement, she compared American border agents managing a humanitarian crisis, that I always said was a humanitarian crisis, and they said it was manufactured.
You know why, right? You know why? Don't say it.
But I think ultimately we win that one.
We love you, North Carolina.
But I mean thousands and thousands of people can't get into these NBA arenas, right? Big arenas.
Reciprocal.
The worst statement I've ever heard.
These are Democrat governors in all instances and Democrat mayors.
You know that right?
Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before.
They are doing great first time ever.
Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody.
We pay the bill.
That wall is stopping them and it's stopping them like never before.
And you know what? They're not supposed to do it, but they did it anyway, they endorsed me.
I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima.
Doesn't make any difference.
We are leading everywhere.
Now you see it and you see what's going up and it's an incredible structure, all capable, all wired up for cameras, for everything you can have.
No matter how you cut it, that's what it is.
They were great.
Anybody want to be with ICE? You got a lot of tough people in New Jersey.
2% military spending.
There's a lot of red up there.
He'll be right at the front.
Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before.
He doesn't know what it is not to fight.
As an example, hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China is eating the cost, which the fake news doesn't want to tell you.

They're the ones that should be impeached, every one of them.
I don't know them.

How about China? He walked out with $1
5 trillion in the US military, including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in Marinette.
The Congressmen.
It's actually less when they did the numbers.
And she was the one that brought it up.
Are we sure that we're in New Hampshire? You know, you have a reputation.
The fact is, we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
We want you to say, â€˜Mr.
They're just very vicious people.
Representative Ayanna Pressle.
Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities.
I do, I like women more.
They're tough, but our ICE folks are even tougher.
With Pennsylvania, I don't have to make a play.
These are warriors, folks.
I think there's no brand to me, that's gone up more than the US Coast Guard.
We support you.
By contrast, I rescued the Minnesota Iron Range, I did that.
And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high.
Not as long as I'm here.
We don't forget.
We've done so much.
They were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal.
But we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years.
Joe is bad primetime.
I said, Mike, take it easy.
They destroyed great people.
I want you to say hello, Tommy Hicks, who's a special friend.
But we had a victory, two victories, North Carolina, where one was 17 points down three weeks ago, we got involved, we started sending out lots of different social media messages, we did a couple of little robo calls, but the big thing, we did a speech the night before.
When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction.
It's Kamala, the most liberal person in the US Senate.
It's disinformation.
No, it's true, I have guys, I have wonderful friends, New York developers, tough guys, smart guys, they're rich, they're this, that.
And it's already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country.
They know they cannot win.
But the dumbest is Joe.
You can't get any worse than her, when you think.
They would have given me so much money to build a wall.
Lara, do you love this state? And her brother's here, I have to tell you, he went to this college.
And plenty of people, even in California where they have sanctuary cities, they don't want sanctuary cities.
al-Baghdadi, the founder and leaderâ€¦ Look, you've heard about it for a long time.
She's got no talent, got nothing.
One year.
Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith.
Where's Mike? Where is he? Mike.
Then they went to recession, there's going to be a recession.
Think of it, a president of the United States who's made our economy, with a lot of help from all of you, frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us, we made this the strongest economy in our history.
Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina.
Europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States.
He betrayed them, what he did to them.
And they like it so much, they gave up the plan.
Right? We are all that stand between the American people and the left wing mob.
But it's going to be very tough for these people ever to get back.
If you're very, very sick, you're not going to make it.
That really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don't want to be shut down any longer.
This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been.
We will never ever stop fighting.
It'll be finished.
There are no crimes.
I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative.
Drudge is starting to treat me good again.
Two and a half years, including the tax cuts which are massive, and including all of the regulatory cuts, and the other things you have gotten, $10,000
And you saw this was the anti-Benghazi.
You don't realize, because you don't know what's happening.
We'll bring it out of retirement very soon.
But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools.
We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country by the thousands.
Then people started â€¦ no she's at 12
We fought like hell.
But I'm not going too far with any of these people because I thought I was way too early with Elizabeth Warren.
For years you had a president who apologized for Americaâ€¦ So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina.
I hate to talk about him.
Quite easy.
He tried to stop us.
We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite.
She pleaded for compassion for Isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization.
Then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France.
I want to thank you both.
We are so respected, you have no idea how our nation has gone so far up in the eyes and the minds of the rest of the world.
Our United States armed forces.
So many people have done so well.
They were all for it.
I recognized Israel's true capitol and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
Your wonderful Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt, what a job he's doing.
Nine inches.
Eliminate private healthcare insurance for 180 million Americans who love their healthcare.
And we have plenty of it.
He's going to go by the science.
We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly.
Next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country, it's heading that way.
Biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids' classroom.
Dana, please stand up.
The states that are open are doing great.
So we're making up for a lot of lost ground.
She accused him of MeToo, she accused him of everything.
You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones.
The people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible, as long as possible.
I have a beautiful building right down the road.
Tomorrow, you will see headlines, Trump wants an extra term, I told you, I told you.
Once you win, money comes in.
And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people aren't getting through.
But just in case she doesn't, we have an insurance policy.
Which, by the way, we set a record in 2016
They all got these massive breaks.
He just said it.
It didn't do too well.
The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten.
So we took in 130 billion a year, going over a three-year period, to 400, just because I asked.
Nice and easy.
They needed it.
No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats.
I said to Ivanka, I said to the first lady, I said to anybody that would listen, I said, listen, this is so great.
They may learn to be vicious after going through this, though.
Yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden's son, where's Hunter? See his first name, I now name â€¦ His first name is where.
I'll tell you what, for our country, that's why I like to see things that we do get honored because nobody is doing what we do.
Finish second to a guy that cannot put two sentences together.
To this day, he has no idea why he got it.
We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, Washington politiciansâ€¦ You know this.
Nobody ever heard of that before.
Doesn't work too well in our country.
Who the hell knows? But it's crazy.
Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, the largest investment in your state's history.
I'll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong and you're going to be doing fracking for a long time.
It's not going to be her.
And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like it's never been before.
Unity.
This crazy Mueller Report comes out, 18 Trump haters, liberal Democrats, some worked for Hillary Clinton, they found nothing.
And if elected, his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets.
They're so nasty to me today.
A lot of people choke.
We would have spent trillions and trillions of dollars.
You better win, Michael.
We are going to take care of our citizens first.
They are great, great heroes of mine, of yours, of everybody's.
A suburbanite, thank you, thank you.
And I made a speech a week ago in Texas.
They don't take your medical machines.
And America is respected again, like it hasn't been for a long time.
But we'll hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which are a disaster.
We had a lot of great Conservatives who wanted it, we had Liberals who wanted it.
We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust, and we're going to keep it that way.
You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you.
And they were all set.
Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of New Hampshire.
