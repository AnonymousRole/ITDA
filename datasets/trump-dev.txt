So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it.
The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country.
People walk right over and it's rotted, rusted, gone.
Nobody has done what we've done for our vets.

He's going to do that for the people of Florida.
Anywhere in the world.
I mean, in all fairness, it's like this, everyone.
Neither does anybody.
He'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal, illegal aliens.
That's not a star.
We're rounding the corner of the pandemic.
You know why? 10 years was too much.
I hate to say it.
How many of these have you come to? Speaking of women, how many of, what is this number one? Like 90, they're great.

And the first time I saw Colby Covington, he walks into the ring.
You see that happening all the time.

And it's Democrats.
That was a heartbreaker.
It makes it very, very prohibitive.
There goes 1
Record stock market.
I wonder in the debate it'll be him and I or the stage.
It wouldn't be pretty, but it's my hair.
If those people, come on, bring them over.
But think of it, they can take something like that, a perfect phone call, or they'll take just out of thin air they can make something up.
But we have to now cement that election.
And they were going crazy on television.
See if you can get them.
When a guy is a friend, it's hard, but they did a lot.
For decades we had politicians that didn't care about that phrase.

But I predict the Sanders people are going to vote for us, like they did the last time.

Then, we'll get back to business.
And that's actually when we learn the most.
We should impeach him.
Oh great, I'm President too.
They just don't know how to do it, because they didn't do a thing for Michigan.
Can you believe it? The levers, they call it the levers of government.
What's happening.
If you like other nations, that's great.

They could change them so quickly.
And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars.
They're a little older now, but they're horrible human beings.
We issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals.
The job that they've done, the doctors, everybody else, we're years ahead of schedule.
And then we are getting them out of the country.
My nose was absolutely just blown apart.
One more, sir.
We got to defend ourself, and there was no guarantee that they'd help us if we ever had a problem.
That I can tell you.
People I love, people I might've helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability.
You have every Democrat fighting you.
He's gone.
And you know what? I'd love to run against him, to be honest.
That was not a good thing for them to say.
Oh, let's put somebody else in as president.
I have no doubt about it, they're in the state department but they'll get them.
And as soon as we want, all of a sudden, they never talk about it.
And today I salute each and every one of those true American heroes and that's what they are.
And he paid a fortune for it.
Because this is not like a second place crowd.

NAFTA, I always say, the world's worst deal.
